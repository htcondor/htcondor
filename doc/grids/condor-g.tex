%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

HTCondor-G is the name given to HTCondor when \SubmitCmdNI{grid}
\SubmitCmdNI{universe} jobs are sent to grid resources utilizing
Globus software for job execution.
The Globus Toolkit provides a framework for building grid systems
and applications.
See the Globus Alliance web page at
\URL{http://www.globus.org}
for descriptions and details of the Globus software.

HTCondor provides the same job management capabilities for HTCondor-G
jobs as for other jobs.
From HTCondor, a user may effectively submit jobs, manage jobs,
and have jobs execute on widely distributed machines.

It may appear that HTCondor-G is a simple replacement
for the Globus Toolkit's \Prog{globusrun} command.
However, HTCondor-G does much more.
It allows the submission of many jobs at once,
along with the monitoring of those jobs with a convenient interface.
There is notification when jobs complete or fail
and maintenance of Globus credentials
that may expire while a job is running.
On top of this, HTCondor-G is a fault-tolerant system;
if a machine crashes,
all of these functions are again available as the machine returns.

Submitting jobs to run under the grid universe has not yet
been perfected.
The following is a list of known limitations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{No checkpoints.}
\item{No job exit codes are available when using \SubmitCmdNI{gt2}.  }
\item{Limited platform availability.  Windows support is not available.  }
\end{enumerate}
