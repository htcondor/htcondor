HTCondor jobs may be submitted to BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure
for Network Computing) servers.
BOINC is a software system for volunteer computing.
More information about BOINC is available at
\URL{http://boinc.berkeley.edu/}.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:Boinc-submit}BOINC Job Submission}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

HTCondor jobs are submitted to a BOINC service
with the \SubmitCmdNI{grid} universe, setting the
\SubmitCmd{grid\_resource} command to \SubmitCmdNI{boinc}, followed 
by the service's URL.

To use this grid type, you must have an account on the BOINC server
that is authorized to submit jobs.
Provide the authenticator string for that account for
HTCondor to use.
Write the authenticator string in a file and specify its location in
the submit description file using the
\SubmitCmd{boinc\_authenticator\_file} command, as in the example:
\begin{verbatim}
boinc_authenticator_file = /path/to/auth-file
\end{verbatim}

Before submitting BOINC jobs, register the application
with the BOINC server.
This includes describing the application's resource requirements and
input and output files, and placing application files on the server.
This is a manual process that is done on the BOINC server.
See the BOINC documentation for details.

In the submit description file, the \SubmitCmd{executable} command
gives the registered name of the application on the BOINC server.
Input and output files can be described as in the vanilla universe,
but the file names must match the application description on the
BOINC server.
If \SubmitCmd{transfer\_output\_files} is omitted, then all output
files are transferred.
