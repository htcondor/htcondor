HTCondor jobs may be submitted to clouds supporting
Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) interface.
The EC2 interface permits on-line commercial services that provide
the rental of computers by the hour to run computational applications.
They run virtual machine images that have been uploaded to Amazon's
online storage service (S3 or EBS).
More information about Amazon's EC2 service is available at
\URL{http://aws.amazon.com/ec2}.

The \SubmitCmdNI{ec2} grid type uses the EC2 Query API,
also called the EC2 REST API.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:Amazon-submit}EC2 Job Submission}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

HTCondor jobs are submitted to an EC2 service
with the \SubmitCmdNI{grid} universe, setting the
\SubmitCmd{grid\_resource} command to \SubmitCmdNI{ec2}, followed 
by the service's URL. For example,
partial contents of the submit description file may be
\begin{verbatim}
grid_resource = ec2 https://ec2.amazonaws.com/
\end{verbatim}

Since the job is a virtual machine image,
most of the submit description file commands
specifying input or output files are not applicable.
The \SubmitCmd{executable} command is still required,
but its value is ignored. 
It can be used to identify different jobs in the output of \Condor{q}.

The VM image for the job must already reside in one of Amazon's storage
service (S3 or EBS) and be registered with EC2.
In the submit description file,
provide the identifier for the image using \SubmitCmd{ec2\_ami\_id}.

\index{grid type!ec2!authentication methods}
This grid type requires access to user authentication information,
in the form of path names to files containing the appropriate keys.

The \SubmitCmdNI{ec2} grid type has two different authentication methods.
The first authentication method uses the EC2 API's built-in authentication.
Specify the service with expected \Expr{http://} or \Expr{https://} URL,
and set the EC2 access key and secret access key as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
ec2_access_key_id = /path/to/access.key
ec2_secret_access_key = /path/to/secret.key
\end{verbatim}

The \Expr{euca3://} and \Expr{euca3s://} protocols must use this 
authentication method.
These protocols exist to work correctly when the resources do not support
the \Param{InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior} parameter.

The second authentication method for the EC2 grid type is X.509.
Specify the service with an \Expr{x509://} URL, 
even if the URL was given in another form.  
Use \SubmitCmd{ec2\_access\_key\_id} to 
specify the path to the X.509 public key (certificate),
which is not the same as the built-in authentication's access key.
\SubmitCmd{ec2\_secret\_access\_key} specifies the path to the X.509 
private key,
which is not the same as the built-in authentication's secret key.
The following example illustrates the specification for X.509 authentication:

\begin{verbatim}
grid_resource = ec2 x509://service.example
ec2_access_key_id = /path/to/x.509/public.key
ec2_secret_access_key = /path/to/x.509/private.key
\end{verbatim}

If using an X.509 proxy, specify the proxy in both places.

HTCondor can use the EC2 API to create an SSH key pair that allows
secure log in to the virtual machine once it is running.
If the command
\SubmitCmd{ec2\_keypair\_file}
is set in the submit description file,
HTCondor will write an SSH private key into the indicated file.
The key can be used to log into the virtual machine.
Note that modification will also be needed of the firewall
rules for the job to incoming SSH connections.

An EC2 service uses a firewall to restrict network access to 
the virtual machine instances it runs.
Typically, no incoming connections are allowed.
One can define sets of firewall rules and give them names.
The EC2 API calls these security groups. 
If utilized, tell HTCondor what set of security
groups should be applied to each VM using the
\SubmitCmd{ec2\_security\_groups} submit description file command.
If not provided, HTCondor uses the security group \SubmitCmdNI{default}.

The EC2 API allows the choice of different hardware configurations 
for instances to run on.
Select which configuration to use for the \SubmitCmdNI{ec2} grid type
with the \SubmitCmd{ec2\_instance\_type} submit description file command.
HTCondor provides no default.

Each virtual machine instance can be given up to 16Kbytes of unique data, 
accessible by the instance by connecting to a well-known address.
This makes it easy for many instances to share the same VM image,
but perform different work.
This data can be specified to HTCondor in one of two ways.
First, the data can be provided directly in the submit description file 
using the \SubmitCmd{ec2\_user\_data} command.
Second, the data can be
stored in a file, and the file name is specified with the
\SubmitCmd{ec2\_user\_data\_file} submit description file command.
This second option allows the use of binary data.
If both options are used, the two blocks of
data are concatenated, with the data from \SubmitCmdNI{ec2\_user\_data} 
occurring first.  HTCondor performs the base64 encoding that EC2 expects on 
the data.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:EC2-termination}Termination of EC2 Jobs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A protocol defines the shutdown procedure for jobs running as
EC2 instances.
The service is told to shut down the instance,
and the service acknowledges.
The service then advances the instance to a state in which
the termination is imminent, but the job is given time to
shut down gracefully.

Once this state is reached, some services other than Amazon cannot be
relied upon to actually terminate the job.
Thus, HTCondor must check that the instance has terminated
before removing the job from the queue.
This avoids the possibility of HTCondor losing track of a job
while it is still accumulating charges on the service.  

HTCondor checks after a fixed time interval
that the job actually has terminated.
If the job has not terminated after a total of four checks,
the job is placed on hold.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:spot-instances}Using Spot Instances}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

EC2 jobs may also be submitted to clouds that support spot instances.
A spot instance differs from a conventional, or dedicated, instance in two
primary ways.
First, the instance price varies according to demand.
Second,
the cloud provider may terminate the instance prematurely.
To start a spot instance,
the submitter specifies a bid,
which represents the most the submitter is willing to pay per hour
to run the VM.
\index{submit commands!ec2\_spot\_price}
Within HTCondor, the submit command \SubmitCmd{ec2\_spot\_price}
specifies this floating point value.
For example, 
to bid 1.1 cents per hour on Amazon:

\begin{verbatim}
ec2_spot_price = 0.011
\end{verbatim}

Note that the EC2 API does not specify how the cloud provider 
should interpret the bid.
Empirically, Amazon uses fractional US dollars.

Other submission details for a spot instance are identical to those
for a dedicated instance.

A spot instance will not necessarily begin immediately.
Instead, 
it will begin as soon as the price drops below the bid.
Thus, spot instance jobs
may remain in the idle state for much longer than dedicated instance jobs,
as they wait for the price to drop.
Furthermore, if the price rises above the bid, 
the cloud service will terminate the instance.

More information about Amazon's spot instances is available at
\URL{http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:Amazon-config}EC2 Configuration Variables}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \SubmitCmdNI{ec2} grid type requires these configuration variables 
to be set in the HTCondor configuration file:

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
EC2_GAHP     = $(SBIN)/ec2_gahp
EC2_GAHP_LOG = /tmp/EC2GahpLog.$(USERNAME)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The \SubmitCmdNI{ec2} grid type does not presently permit the explicit use 
of an HTTP proxy.

The specification of a service with an \Expr{https://}, an \Expr{x509://},
or an \Expr{euca3s://} URL validates that service's certificate,
checking that a trusted certificate authority (CA) signed it.
Commercial EC2 service providers generally use certificates signed by 
widely-recognized CAs.
These CAs will usually work without any additional configuration.  
For other providers, a specification of trusted CAs may be needed.
Without, errors such as the following will be in the EC2 GAHP log:

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
06/13/13 15:16:16 curl_easy_perform() failed (60): 
'Peer certificate cannot be authenticated with given CA certificates'.
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Specify trusted CAs by including their certificates in a group of trusted CAs
either in an on disk directory or in a single file. 
Either of these alternatives may contain multiple certificates.  
Which is used will vary from system to system, 
depending on the system's SSL implementation. 
HTCondor uses \Prog{libcurl}; 
information about the \Prog{libcurl} specification of trusted CAs
is available at 

\URL{http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl\_easy\_setopt.html}

Versions of HTCondor with standard universe support ship with their 
own \Prog{libcurl}, which will be linked against \Prog{OpenSSL}.

The behavior when specifying both a directory and a file is undefined, 
although the EC2 GAHP allows it.

The EC2 GAHP will set the CA file to whichever variable it finds first, 
checking these in the following order:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The environment variable \Env{X509\_CERT\_FILE},
  set when the \Condor{master} starts up.
\item The HTCondor configuration variable \Macro{SOAP\_SSL\_CA\_FILE}.
\end{enumerate}

The EC2 GAHP supplies no default value, if it does not find a CA file.

The EC2 GAHP will set the CA directory given whichever of these
variables it finds first, 
checking in the following order:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The HTCondor configuration variable \Macro{GSI\_DAEMON\_TRUSTED\_CA\_DIR}.
\item The environment variable \Env{X509\_CERT\_DIR},
  set when the \Condor{master} starts up.
\item The HTCondor configuration variable \Macro{SOAP\_SSL\_CA\_DIR}.
\end{enumerate}

The EC2 GAHP supplies no default value, if it does not find a CA directory.

By default, HTCondor assumes that EC2 services are reliably available.
If an attempt to contact a service during the normal course of operation fails,
HTCondor makes a special attempt to contact the service.
If this attempt fails, 
the service is marked as down,
and normal operation for that service is
suspended until a subsequent special attempt succeeds.  
The jobs using that service do not go on hold.
To place jobs on hold when their service becomes unavailable,
set configuration variable \Macro{EC2\_RESOURCE\_TIMEOUT} to 
the number of seconds to delay before placing the job on hold.
The default value of -1 for this variable implements 
an infinite delay, such that the job is never placed on hold.
When setting this value, 
consider the value of configuration variable
\Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_RESOURCE\_PROBE\_INTERVAL},
which sets the number of seconds that HTCondor will wait after each
special contact attempt before trying again.
