HTCondor jobs may be submitted to Deltacloud services.
Deltacloud is a translation service for cloud services,
with more information at \URL{http://deltacloud.apache.org/}.
Cloud services allow the rental of computers by the hour to run
computation applications.
Many cloud services define their own protocol for users to communicate
with them.
Deltacloud defines its own simple protocol and translates a user's
commands into the appropriate protocol for the cloud service the user
specifies.
Anyone can set up a Deltacloud service and configure it to translate
for a specific cloud service.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:Deltacloud-submit}Deltacloud Job Submission}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

HTCondor jobs are submitted to Deltacloud
using the \SubmitCmd{grid} universe and the
\SubmitCmd{grid\_resource} command
in the submit description file
following this example:
\begin{verbatim}
grid_resource = deltacloud https://deltacloud.foo.org/api
\end{verbatim}

The URL in this example will be replaced with the URL of the
Deltacloud service desired.

Since the job is a virtual machine image,
most of the submit description file commands
specifying input or output files are not applicable.
The \SubmitCmd{executable} command is still required,
but its value is ignored. 
It can be used to identify different jobs in the output of \Condor{q}.

The VM image for the job must already be stored and registered with the
cloud service.
In the submit description file,
provide the identifier for the image using the
\SubmitCmd{deltacloud\_image\_id} command.

To authenticate with Deltacloud, HTCondor needs your credentials for
the cloud service that the Deltacloud server is representing. 
The credentials are
presented as a user name and the name of a file that holds a secret key.
Both are specified in the submit description file:

\begin{verbatim}
deltacloud_username = your_username
deltacloud_password_file = /path/to/file/with/password
\end{verbatim}

You can create and register an SSH key pair with the cloud service,
which you can then use to securely log in to virtual machines,
once running.
The command \SubmitCmd{deltacloud\_keyname} in the
submit description file specifies the identifier of the SSH key pair
to use.

The cloud service may have multiple locations where the virtual
machine can run. 
The submit description file command \SubmitCmd{deltacloud\_realm\_id}
selects one.
If not specified, the service will select a sensible default.

The cloud service may offer several hardware configurations for
instances to run on.
Select which configuration to use with the
\SubmitCmd{deltacloud\_hardware\_profile} submit description file command. 
If not specified, the cloud service will select a sensible default.
The optional commands \SubmitCmd{deltacloud\_hardware\_profile\_memory},
\SubmitCmd{deltacloud\_hardware\_profile\_cpu}, and
\SubmitCmd{deltacloud\_hardware\_profile\_storage}
customize the selected hardware profile.

Each virtual machine instance can be given some unique data, 
accessible by the instance connecting to a well-known address.
This makes it easy for many instances to share the same VM image,
but perform different work.
This data can be specified with the submit description file command
\SubmitCmd{deltacloud\_user\_data}.
The amount of data that can be provided depends on the cloud service.
EC2 services allow up to 16Kb of data.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:Deltacloud-config}Configuration for Deltacloud}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

One configuration variable 
must be set for Deltacloud.
It specifies the path and executable of the \Prog{deltacloud\_gahp}:

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
DELTACLOUD_GAHP = $(SBIN)/deltacloud_gahp
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
