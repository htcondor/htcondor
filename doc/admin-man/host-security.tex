\section{\label{sec:Host-Security}Setting Up IP/Host-Based Security in
Condor} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This section describes the mechanisms for setting up Condor's
host-based security.  This allows you to control what machines can
join your Condor pool, what machines can find out information about
your pool, and what machines within your pool can perform
administrative commands.  By default, Condor is configured to allow
anyone to view or join your pool.  You probably want to change that.

First, we discuss how the host-based security works inside Condor.
Then, we list the different levels of access you can grant and what
parts of Condor use which levels.  Next, we describe how to configure
your pool to grant (or deny) certain levels of access to various
machines.  Finally, we provide some examples of how you might
configure your pool.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:How-Host-Security-Works}How does it work?}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Inside the Condor daemons or tools that use DaemonCore (see
section~\ref{sec:DaemonCore} on ``DaemonCore'' for details), most
things are accomplished by sending commands to another Condor daemon.
These commands are just an integer to specify which command, followed
by any optional information that the protocol requires at that point
(such as a ClassAd, capability string, etc).  When the daemons start
up, they register which commands they are willing to accept, what to
do with them when they arrive, and what access level is required for
that command.  When a command comes in, Condor sees what access level
is required, and then checks the IP address of the machine that sent
the command and makes sure it passes the various allow/deny settings
in your config file for that access level.  If permission is granted,
the command continues.  If not, the command is aborted.

As you would expect, settings for the access levels in your global
config file will affect all the machines in your pool.  Settings in a
local config file will only affect that specific machine.  The
settings for a given machine determine what other hosts can send
commands to that machine.  So, if you want machine ``foo'' to have
administrator access on to machine ``bar'', you need to put ``foo'' in
bar's config file access list, not the other way around.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Security-Access-Levels}Security Access Levels} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The following are the various access levels that commands within
Condor can be registered with:

\begin{description}

\item[\DCPerm{READ}] \label{dcperm:read} Machines with \DCPerm{READ}
   access can read information from Condor.  For example, they can
   view the status of the pool, see the job queue(s) or view user
   permissions.  \DCPerm{READ} access does not allow for anything to
   be changed or jobs to be submitted.  Basically, a machine listed
   with \DCPerm{READ} permission cannot join a condor pool - it can
   only view information about the pool.

\item[\DCPerm{WRITE}] \label{dcperm:write} Machines with
   \DCPerm{WRITE} access can write information to condor.  Most
   notably, it means that it can join your pool by sending ClassAd
   updates to your central manager and can talk to the other machines
   in your pool to submit or run jobs.  In addition, any machine with
   \DCPerm{WRITE} access can request the \Condor{startd} to perform a
   periodic checkpoint on any job it is currently executing (after a
   periodic checkpoint, the job will continue to execute and the
   machine will still be claimed by whatever schedd had claimed it).
   This allows users on the machines where they submitted their jobs
   to use the \Condor{checkpoint} command to get their jobs to
   periodically checkpoint, even if they don't have an account on the
   remote execute machine.

   \textbf{IMPORTANT:} For a machine to join a condor pool, it must
   have \DCPerm{WRITE} permission \textbf{AND} \DCPerm{READ} permission!
   (Just \DCPerm{WRITE} permission is not enough).

\item[\DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR}] \label{dcperm:administrator} Machines
   with \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR} access have special Condor
   administrator rights to the pool.  This includes things like
   changing user priorities (with ``\Condor{userprio -set}''), turning
   Condor on and off (``\Condor{off $<$machine$>$}), asking Condor to
   reconfigure or restart itself, etc.  Typically you would want only
   a couple machines in this list - perhaps the workstations where the
   Condor administrators or sysadmins typically work, or perhaps just
   your Condor central manager.

   \textbf{IMPORTANT:} This is host-wide access we're talking about.
   So, if you grant \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR} access to a given machine,
   \textbf{ANY USER} on that machine now has \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR}
   rights.  Therefore, you should grant \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR} access
   carefully.

\item[\DCPerm{OWNER}] \label{dcperm:owner} This level of access is
   required for commands that the owner of a machine (any local user)
   should be able to use, in addition to the Condor administrators.
   For example the \Condor{vacate} command that causes the
   \Condor{startd} to vacate any running condor job is registered with
   \DCPerm{OWNER} permission, so that anyone can issue \Condor{vacate}
   to the local machine they are logged into.

\item[\DCPerm{NEGOTIATOR}] \label{dcperm:negotiator} This is a special
   access level that means the specified command must come from the
   Central Manager of your pool.  The commands that have this access
   level are the ones that tell the \Condor{schedd} to begin
   negotiating and that tell an available \Condor{startd} that it has
   been matched to a \Condor{schedd} with jobs to run.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Config-DCPerms}Configuring your Pool}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\DCPerm{NEGOTIATOR} permission is handled automatically by Condor, and
there is nothing special you need to configure.  The other four
permissions, \DCPerm{READ}, \DCPerm{WRITE}, \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR} and
\DCPerm{OWNER} need to be specified in the config files.  See the
section on Configuring Condor for details on where these files might
be located, general information about how to set parameters, and how
to reconfigure the Condor daemons.

\DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR} access defaults to only your central manager.
\DCPerm{OWNER} access defaults to the local machine, and any machines
listed with \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR} access.  You can probably leave
that how it is.  If you want other machines to have \DCPerm{OWNER}
access, you probably want them to have \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR} access
as well.  By granting machines \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR} access, they
would automatically have \DCPerm{OWNER} access, given how
\DCPerm{OWNER} access is configured.

For these permissions, you can optionally list an ALLOW or a DENY.
\begin{itemize}

\item If you have an ALLOW, it means "only allow these machines".  No
    ALLOW means allow anyone.

\item If you have a DENY, it means "deny these machines".  No DENY
    means to deny nobody.

\item If you have both an ALLOW and a DENY, it means allow the
    machines listed in ALLOW except for the machines listed in DENY.
\end{itemize}

Therefore, the settings you might set are:
\begin{verbatim}
        HOSTALLOW_READ = <machines>
        HOSTDENY_READ = ...
        HOSTALLOW_WRITE = ...
        HOSTDENY_WRITE = ...
        HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR = ...
        HOSTDENY_ADMINISTRATOR = ...
        HOSTALLOW_OWNER = ...
        HOSTDENY_OWNER = ...
\end{verbatim}

Machines can be listed by:

\begin{itemize}
\item Individual hostnames - example: condor.cs.wisc.edu
\item Individual IP address - example: 128.105.67.29
\item IP subnets (use a trailing ``*'') - examples: 144.105.*, 128.105.67.*
\item Hostnames with a wildcard ``*'' character (only one ``*'' is
    allowed per name) - examples: *.cs.wisc.edu, sol*.cs.wisc.edu
\end{itemize}

Multiple machine entries can be separated by either a space or a comma.

For resolving something that falls into both allow and deny: Individual
machines have a higher order of precedence than wildcard entries, and
hostnames with a wildcard have a higher order of precedence than IP
subnets.  Otherwise, DENY has a higher order of precedence than ALLOW.
(this is intuitively how most people would expect it to work).  

In addition, you can specify any of the above access levels on a
per-daemon basis, instead of machine-wide for all daemons.  You do
this with the subsystem string (described in
section~\ref{sec:Condor-Subsystem-Names} on ``Subsystem Names''),
which is one of: ``STARTD'', ``SCHEDD'', ``MASTER'', ``NEGOTIATOR'',
or ``COLLECTOR''.  For example, if you wanted to grant different read
access for the \Condor{schedd}:
\begin{verbatim}
        HOSTALLOW_READ_SCHEDD = <machines>
\end{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:DCPerm-per-Daemon}Access Levels each Daemons
Uses} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Here are all the commands registered in Condor, what daemon registers
them, and what permission they are registered with.  With this
information, you should be able to grant exactly the permission you
wish for your pool:


STARTD:

\begin{description}
\item[\DCPerm{WRITE}] : All commands that relate to a schedd claiming
  the startd, starting jobs there, and stopping those jobs.

  The command that \Condor{checkpoint} sends to periodically checkpoint
  all running jobs.

\item[\DCPerm{READ}] : The command that \Condor{preen} sends to find the
  current state of the startd.

\item[\DCPerm{OWNER}] : The command that \Condor{vacate} sends to vacate
  any running jobs.

\item[\DCPerm{NEGOTIATOR}] : The command that the negotiator sends to
  match this startd with a given schedd.
\end{description}

NEGOTIATOR:

\begin{description}
\item[\DCPerm{WRITE}] : The command that initiates a new negotiation
  cycle (sent by the schedd when new jobs are submitted, or someone
  issues a \Condor{reschedule}).

\item[\DCPerm{READ}] : The command that can retrieve the current state
  of user priorities in the pool (what \Condor{userprio} sends).

\item[\DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR}] : The command that can set the current
  values of user priorities (what \Condor{userprio -set} sends).
\end{description}

COLLECTOR:

\begin{description}
\item[\DCPerm{WRITE}] : All commands that update the collector with
new ClassAds.

\item[\DCPerm{READ}] : All commands that query the collector for
ClassAds.
\end{description}

SCHEDD: 

\begin{description}
\item[\DCPerm{NEGOTIATOR}] : The command that the negotiator sends to
  begin negotiating with this schedd to match its jobs with available
  startds.

\item[\DCPerm{WRITE}] : The command which \Condor{reschedule} sends to
  the schedd to get it to update the collector with a current ClassAd
  and begin a negotiation cycle.

  The commands that a startd sends to the schedd when it must vacate
  its jobs and release the schedd's claim.

  The commands which write information into the job queue (such as
  \Condor{submit}, \Condor{hold}, etc).  
  Note that for most commands which try to write to the job queue, Condor
  will perform an additional user-level authentication step.  
  This additional user-level authentication prevents, for example, an
  ordinary user from removing a different user's jobs.

\item[\DCPerm{OWNER}] : The command that \Condor{reconfig\_schedd}
  sends to get the schedd to re-read it's config files.

\item[\DCPerm{READ}] : The command which all
  tools which view the status of the job queue send (such as
  \Condor{q}).  
\end{description}

MASTER:  All commands are registered with \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR}
access:

\begin{description}
\item[reconfig] : Master and all its children reconfigure themselves
\item[restart] : Master restarts itself (and all its children)	
\item[off] : Master shuts down all its children
\item[on] : Master spawns all the daemons it's configured to spawn
\item[master\_off] : Master shuts down all its children and exits
\end{description}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:DCPerm-Examples}Access Level Examples}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Notice in all these examples that \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR} access is
only granted through a HOSTALLOW setting to explicitly grant access to
a small number of machines.  We recommend this.

\begin{itemize}

\item Let anyone join your pool.  Only your central manager has
administrative access (this is the default that ships with Condor)
\begin{verbatim}
HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR = $(CONDOR_HOST)
HOSTALLOW_OWNER = $(FULL_HOSTNAME), $(HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR)
\end{verbatim}

\item Only allow machines at NCSA to join or view the pool, Central
Manager is the only machine with \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR} access.
\begin{verbatim}
HOSTALLOW_READ = *.ncsa.uiuc.edu
HOSTALLOW_WRITE = *.ncsa.uiuc.edu
HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR = $(CONDOR_HOST)
HOSTALLOW_OWNER = $(FULL_HOSTNAME), $(HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR)
\end{verbatim}

\item Only allow machines at NCSA and U of I Math department join the
pool, EXCEPT do \textbf{not} allow lab machines to do so.  Also do not
allow the 177.55 subnet (perhaps this is the dial-in subnet).  Allow
anyone to view pool statistics.  Only let "bigcheese" administer the
pool (not the central manager).
\begin{verbatim}
HOSTALLOW_WRITE = *.ncsa.uiuc.edu, *.math.uiuc.edu
HOSTDENY_WRITE = lab-*.edu, *.lab.uiuc.edu, 177.55.*
HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR = bigcheese.ncsa.uiuc.edu
HOSTALLOW_OWNER = $(FULL_HOSTNAME), $(HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR)
\end{verbatim}

\item Only allow machines at NCSA and UW-Madison's CS department to
view the pool.  Only NCSA machines and ``raven.cs.wisc.edu'' can join
the pool: (Note: raven has the read access it needs through the
wildcard setting in \Macro{HOSTALLOW\_READ}).  This example also shows
how you could use ``\verb@\@'' to continue a long list of machines
onto multiple lines, making it more readable (this works for all
config file entries, not just host access entries, see
section~\ref{sec:Configuring-Condor} on ``Configuring Condor'' for
details).
\begin{verbatim}
HOSTALLOW_READ = *.ncsa.uiuc.edu, *.cs.wisc.edu
HOSTALLOW_WRITE = *.ncsa.uiuc.edu, raven.cs.wisc.edu
HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR = $(CONDOR_HOST), bigcheese.ncsa.uiuc.edu, \
                          biggercheese.uiuc.edu
HOSTALLOW_OWNER = $(FULL_HOSTNAME), $(HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR)
\end{verbatim}

\item Allow anyone except the military to view the status of your
pool, but only let machines at NCSA view the job queues.  Only NCSA
machines can join the pool. The central manager, bigcheese, and
biggercheese can perform most administrative functions.  However, only
``biggercheese'' can update user priorities.
\begin{verbatim}
HOSTDENY_READ = *.mil
HOSTALLOW_READ_SCHEDD = *.ncsa.uiuc.edu 
HOSTALLOW_WRITE = *.ncsa.uiuc.edu
HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR = $(CONDOR_HOST), bigcheese.ncsa.uiuc.edu, \
                          biggercheese.uiuc.edu
HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR_NEGOTIATOR = biggercheese.uiuc.edu
HOSTALLOW_OWNER = $(FULL_HOSTNAME), $(HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR)
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}
