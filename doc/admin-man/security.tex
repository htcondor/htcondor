\index{security! in Condor|(}

Security in Condor is a broad issue, with many aspects to consider.
Because Condor's main purpose is to allow users to run
arbitrary code on large numbers of computers,
it is important to try to
limit who can access a Condor pool and what privileges they have when
using the pool.
This section covers these topics. 

It is important to understand what kinds of resource attacks 
Condor can prevent, and which attacks it cannot prevent.
Condor will not prevent security breaches
of users
that can elevate their privilege to the root or
administrator account.
Condor does not run user jobs in sandboxes
(standard universe jobs are a partial exception to this),
so it cannot prevent
malicious actions by user jobs.
An example might be a job that launches distributed denial of service
attacks.
Condor assumes that that users are trustworthy.
Condor can
prevent unauthorized access to the Condor pool,
to help you ensure that only trusted users have access to the pool.
In addition,
Condor provides encryption and integrity checking,
to ensure that data
(both Condor's data and user jobs' data)
has not been examined or tampered with. 

Broadly speaking, there are a few important aspects to security in
Condor: 

\begin{description}

\item[Users] Because privilege or capability in an operating system
is based on a process owner,
which process owner (or user) a job or Condor daemon is run
as is critical.
%What user is used to run the Condor daemons? What user is
%used to run jobs? 
The Condor system 
prefers that Condor daemons are run as the user root,
while other common operations are to be owned by
a separate user.
% Karen's edit to this point in this file.
This is usually the
\File{condor} user, but any user can be chosen. This topic is discussed
in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:uids}. 

\item[Authentication] When someone submits a job to Condor, how do you
know who it is? The process by which is determine who a user is, is
called authentication. By default, Condor's authentication simply uses
the user id (or uid) to determine who a user is, but Condor can use a
variety of authentication mechanisms including Kerberos and GSI to
perform authentication more securely. 

\item[Authorization] Once you have authenticated a user and you know
who it is, what are they allowed to do? Some users are allowed to
submit jobs, while other users are allowed Condor administration
privileges. Condor provides facilities for deciding what different
users are authorized to do. 

\item[Privacy] Condor can encrypt data sent across the network, which
can normally prevent other people from your data. (If someone is
persistent enough and has sufficient computing power, they could
decrypt it, but this is unlikely.) Condor can encrypt either the data
that it sends for internal communication, or user data, such as files
and executables. Note that the encryption is used for network
transmissions: data is still stored on disk unencrypted.

\item[Integrity] Condor can send additional cryptographic data that
can be used to verify that network data transmissions have not been
tampered with. This can be used to prevent so-called ``man-in-the
middle'' attacks in which an attacker changes the data being sent
across the network without either side being aware of the
modifications. Note that the integrity information is only for network
transmissions: data stored on disk does not have this integrity
information. 

\end{description}

The following subsections describe these topics in more detail. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:uids}User Accounts in Condor}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{UIDs in Condor|(}

On a Unix system,
UIDs (User IDentification numbers) form part of an operating system's
tools for maintaining access control.
Each executing program has a UID,
a unique identifier of a user executing the program.
This is also called the real UID.
\index{UID!real}
A common situation has one user executing the program owned
by another user.
Many system commands work this way, with a user (corresponding
to a person) executing a program belonging to (owned by) root.
Since the program may require privileges that root has which
the user does not have, a special bit in the program's
protection specification (a setuid bit) allows the program
to run with the UID of the program's owner, instead of the
user that executes the program.
This UID of the program's owner is called an effective UID.
\index{UID!effective}

%GID (group identification)
Condor works most smoothly when its daemons run as root.
The daemons then have the ability to switch their 
effective UIDs at will.
When the daemons run as root,
they normally leave their effective UID and GID (Group IDentification)
to be those of user and group \verb@condor@.
This allows access to the log files without
changing the ownership of the log files.
It also allows access to these files when
the user condor's home directory resides on an NFS server.
root can not normally access NFS files.

If there is no \verb@condor@ user and group on the system, an
administrator can specify which UID and GID the Condor daemons should
use when they do not need root privileges in two ways, 
either with the \Env{CONDOR\_IDS} environment variable or the
\Macro{CONDOR\_IDS} configuration file setting.
In either case, the value should be the UID integer, followed by a
period, followed by the GID integer.
For example, if a Condor administrator does not want to create a
\verb@condor@ user, and instead wants their Condor daemons to run as
the \verb@daemon@ user (a common non-root user for system daemons to
execute as), the \verb@daemon@ user's UID was 2, and group
\verb@daemon@ had a GID of 2, the corresponding setting in the Condor
configuration file would be \verb@CONDOR_IDS = 2.2@.

On a machine where a job is submitted,
the \Condor{schedd} daemon
changes its effective UID to root
such that it has the capability to start up a \Condor{shadow} daemon
for the job.
Before a \Condor{shadow} daemon is created,
the \Condor{schedd} daemon
switches back to root,
so that it can start up the \Condor{shadow} daemon with the (real) UID
of the user who submitted the job.
Since the \Condor{shadow} runs as the owner of the job,
all remote system calls are performed under the owner's UID
and GID.
This ensures that as the job executes,
it can access only files that its owner could access if the job
were running locally, without Condor.

On the machine where the job executes, the 
job runs either as the submitting user or as user nobody,
to help ensure that the job cannot access local resources or do harm.  
If the \Macro{UID\_DOMAIN} matches,
and the user exists as the same UID in password files
on both the submitting machine and on the execute machine,
the job will run as the submitting user.
However, if the user does not exist in the execute machine's
password file and \Macro{SOFT\_UID\_DOMAIN} is True,
then Condor will choose the submitting user's UID on the
execute machine.
If \MacroNI{SOFT\_UID\_DOMAIN} is False,
and \MacroNI{UID\_DOMAIN} matches,
and the user is not in the execute machine's password file,
then the job will run as user nobody.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:Non-Root}Running Condor as Non-Root}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

While we strongly recommend starting up the Condor daemons as root, we
understand that it is not always possible to do so.  The main problems
appear if you have one Condor installation shared by many users on a
single machine, or if you are setting up machines to only execute
Condor jobs.  If you are setting up a submit-only installation for a
single user, then there is no need for (or benefit from) running as
root.

What follows are the effects on the various parts of Condor of running
both with and without root access.

\begin{description}

\item[\Condor{startd}] If you're setting up a machine to run Condor
   jobs and don't start the \Condor{startd} as root, you're basically
   relying on the goodwill of your Condor users to agree to the policy
   you configure the startd to enforce as far as starting, suspending,
   vacating and killing Condor jobs under certain conditions.  If you
   run as root, however, you can enforce these policies regardless of
   malicious users.  By running as root, the Condor daemons run with a
   different UID than the Condor job that gets started (since the
   user's job is started as either the UID of the user who submitted
   it, or as user ``nobody'', depending on the \Macro{UID\_DOMAIN}
   settings).  Therefore, the Condor job cannot do anything to the
   Condor daemons.  If you don't start the daemons as root, all
   processes started by Condor, including the end user's job, run with
   the same UID (since you can't switch UIDs unless you're root).
   Therefore, a user's job could just kill the \Condor{startd} and
   \Condor{starter} as soon as it starts up and by doing so, avoid
   getting suspended or vacated when a user comes back to the machine.
   This is nice for the user, since they get unlimited access to the
   machine, but awful for the machine owner or administrator.  If you
   trust the users submitting jobs to Condor, this might not be a
   concern.  However, to ensure that the policy you choose is
   effectively enforced by Condor, the \Condor{startd} should be
   started as root.

   In addition, some system information cannot be obtained without
   root access on some platforms (such as load average on IRIX).  As a
   result, when running without root access, the \Condor{startd} has to
   call other programs (for example, ``uptime'') to get this
   information.  This is much less efficient than getting the
   information directly from the kernel (which is what we do if we're
   running as root).  On Linux and Solaris, we can get this
   information directly without root access, so this is not a concern
   on those platforms.

   If you can't have all of Condor running as root, at least consider
   whether you can install the \Condor{startd} as setuid root.  That
   would solve both of these problems.  If you can't do that, you
   could also install it as a setgid sys or kmem program (depending on
   whatever group has read access to \File{/dev/kmem} on your system)
   and that would at least solve the system information problem.

\item[\Condor{schedd}] The biggest problem running the schedd
    without root access is that the \Condor{shadow} processes which it
    spawns are stuck with the same UID the \Condor{schedd} has.  This
    means that users submitting their jobs have to go out of their way
    to grant write access to user or group condor (or whoever the
    schedd is running as) for any files or directories their jobs
    write or create.  Similarly, read access must be granted to their
    input files.

    You might consider installing \Condor{submit} as a setgid condor
    program so that at least the \File{stdout}, \File{stderr} and
    \File{UserLog} files get created with the right permissions.  If
    \Condor{submit} is a setgid program, it will automatically set
    it's umask to 002, so that creates group-writable files.  This
    way, the simple case of a job that just writes to \File{stdout}
    and \File{stderr} will work.  If users have programs that open
    their own files, they'll have to know to set the right permissions
    on the directories they submit from.

\item[\Condor{master}] The \Condor{master} is what spawns the
    \Condor{startd} and \Condor{schedd}, so if want them both running
    as root, you should have the master run as root.  This happens
    automatically if you start the master from your boot scripts.

\item[\Condor{negotiator} and \Condor{collector}]
There is no need to have either of these daemons running as root.

\item[\Condor{kbdd}] On platforms that need the \Condor{kbdd} (Digital
    Unix and IRIX) the \Condor{kbdd} has to run as root.  If it is
    started as any other user, it will not work.  You might consider
    installing this program as a setuid root binary if you can't run
    the \Condor{master} as root.  Without the \Condor{kbdd}, the
    startd has no way to monitor mouse activity at all, and the only
    keyboard activity it will notice is activity on ttys (such as
    xterms, remote logins, etc).

\end{description}

If you do choose to run Condor as non-root, then you can almost any
user you like. A common choice is to use the condor user: this
simplifies the setup because Condor will look for its configuration
files in the Condor user's directory. If you don't select the condor
user, then you will need to ensure that CONDOR\_CONFIG is set
properly so that Condor can find it's configuration files. 

If users will be submitting jobs as a user different than the user
Condor is running as (perhaps you are running as the condor user and
users are submitting as themselves), then users have to be careful to
only have file permissions properly set up to be accessible by the
user Condor is using. In practice, this means creating world-writable
directories for output from Condor jobs.  This creates a potential
security risk, in that any user on the machine where the job is
submitted can alter the data, remove it, or do other undesirable
things.  It is only acceptable in an environment where users can trust
other users.

Normally, users without root access who wish to use Condor on their
machines create a \File{condor} home directory somewhere within their
own accounts and start up the daemons (to run with the UID of the
user).  As in the case where the daemons run as user condor, there is
no ability to switch UIDs or GIDs.  The daemons run as the UID and GID
of the user who started them.  On a machine where jobs are submitted,
the \Condor{shadow} daemons all run as this same user.  However, if
other users on the machine are using Condor in this environment, the
\Condor{shadow} daemons for these other users' jobs execute with the
UID of the user who started the daemons.  This is a security risk,
since the Condor job of the other user has access to all the files and
directories of the user who started the daemons.  Some installations
have this level of trust, but others do not.  Where this level of
trust does not exist, it is best to set up a condor account and group,
or to have each user start up their own Personal Condor submit
installation.

When a machine is an execution site for a Condor job, the Condor job
executes with the UID of the user who started the \Condor{startd}
daemon.  This is also potentially a security risk, which is why we do
not recommend starting up the execution site daemons as a regular
user.  Use either root or a user (such as the user condor) that exists
only to run Condor jobs.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:RunAsNobody}Running Jobs as the Nobody User}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{user nobody!potential security risk with jobs}
\index{UID!potential risk running jobs as user nobody}
\index{security!running jobs as user nobody}

Under Unix, Condor runs jobs either as the user that submitted the jobs,
or as the user called nobody.
Condor uses user nobody if the value of the \MacroNI{UID\_DOMAIN}
configuration variable of the
submitting and executing machines are different.

When Condor cleans up after a executing a vanilla universe job,
Condor does the best that it can by
deleting all of the processes started by the job.
Unfortunately, it is possible to fool Condor,
and leave processes behind after Condor has cleaned up.
If the job is running as user nobody,
it is possible for it to leave a lurker process lying in wait
for the next job run as nobody.
The lurker process may prey maliciously on the next nobody user job,
wreaking havoc.

Condor could prevent this problem by simply killing all processes run by
the nobody user, but this would annoy many system administrators.
The nobody user is often used for non-Condor system processes.

Condor provides a two-part solution to this difficulty.
First, create user accounts specifically for Condor to use instead
of user nobody.
These can be low-privilege accounts,
as the nobody user is.
Create one of these accounts for each
virtual machine per computer,
so that distinct users can be used for concurrent processes.
This prevents malicious behavior between
processes running on distinct virtual machines.
Section ~\ref{sec:Configuring-SMP} details virtual machines.
For a sample machine with two virtual machines,
create two users that are intended only to be used by Condor.
As an example, call them nobody1 and nobody2.
Tell Condor about these users
with the \Macro{VMx\_USER} configuration variables,
where x is replaced with the
virtual machine number. In this example:

\begin{verbatim}
   VM1_USER = nobody1
   VM2_USER = nobody2
\end{verbatim}

Reconfigure Condor, so that Condor will make use of these users
instead of the nobody user.
One more change is required to prevent lurker processes:
tell Condor that these accounts are intended only to be used by Condor,
so Condor can kill all the processes belonging to these users upon
job completion.
The configuration variable \Macro{EXECUTE\_LOGIN\_IS\_DEDICATED}
is introduced and set to True for this purpose.

\begin{verbatim}
   EXECUTE_LOGIN_IS_DEDICATED = TRUE
\end{verbatim}

Notes:
\begin{enumerate}

\item{
If \MacroNI{UID\_DOMAIN} is not set in the configuration, do not
set \MacroNI{EXECUTE\_LOGIN\_IS\_DEDICATED}.
In this case, lurker processes are not a concern,
and other processes that a user may have running would be killed
improperly.
}

\item{
This only applies to vanilla universe and Java universe jobs.
Standard universe jobs are not a concern,
because they are not allowed to create new processes.
}

\item{
On Windows, \MacroNI{VMx\_USER} will only work if the credential
of the specified user is stored on the execute machine
using \Condor{condor\_store\_cred}.
See the \Condor{condor\_store\_cred}
manual page (in section~\ref{man-condor-store-cred}) for details of this command.
}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\label{sec:DirOfJob}Working Directories for Jobs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{cwd!of jobs}

Any executing process has a notion of its current working directory
which is the the directory that acts as the base for all file system
access.  There are two parts for any Condor job: the submit portion
(where the job was submitted) and the execution portion (where the job
runs).  This implies that there are two working directories.  When a
user submits a job, the current working directory for the job will be
it was for the user when they executed the \Condor{submit} command,
unless it is changed with the initialdir option in the submit
description file. This allows different jobs to have different working
directories, and it can be very useful when submitting large numbers
of jobs. This submit working directory remains unchanged for the
entire life of a job.  The submit side working directory is also used
as the working directory of the \Condor{shadow} daemon.  This is
particularly relevant for standard universe jobs since file system
access for the job goes through the \Condor{shadow} daemon and
therefore all accesses behave as if they were executing without
Condor.

There is also a working directory associated with the Condor job on
the execution machine.  For standard universe jobs, it is set to the
\File{execute} subdirectory of Condor's home directory.  This
directory is world-writable, since a Condor job usually runs as user
nobody.  Normally, standard universe jobs would never access this
directory, since all I/O system calls are passed back to the
\Condor{shadow} daemon on the submit machine.  However, in the event
that the job that creates a core dump, the working directory on the
execute machine needs to be accessible by the job so that it can write
the core file.  The core file is moved back to the submit machine, and
the \Condor{shadow} daemon is informed.  The \Condor{shadow} daemon
sends e-mail to the job owner announcing the crash and providing a
pointer to the core file, then residing in the submit side working directory

\index{UIDs in Condor|)}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Config-Security}Basic Security Configuration}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Condor provides support for strong authentication, encryption,
integrity assurance, as well as authorization, as described in
Section~\ref{sec:Security}. However, Condor does not turn on these
features by default, for two reasons. First, setting up strong
authentication and authorization require extra support outside of
Condor, such as GSI certificates or a Kerberos Key Distribution Center
(KDC). Second, past versions of Condor did not support strong security
so the default configuration of Condor works correctly when
interoperating with new or old installations of Condor.

The default security configuration in Condor is host-based security
and is described in Section~\ref{sec:Host-Security}. This form of security
limits access to Condor based on IP addresses. For example, Condor can
be configured to allow job submissions from everyone in the
example.com domain, but administrator commands must be run from
command.example.com. Host-based security does not distinguish users,
so in the example, anyone that has access to command.example.com may
run administrator commands. It is also subject to attacks that fake IP
addresses. Although host-based security is limited, it is acceptable
for many small installations, particularly if they are on private
networks. For the remainder of this section, we will not discuss
host-based security further.

The following sections will describe specific configuration options
for strong security configurations. However, a number of configuration
options are common to each of them, so they are discussed together.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:client-vs-daemon}Client Versus Daemon
Security Configuration}
The security configuration can be broken into two parts: the client
and the daemon. The client is the party that initiates communication,
while the daemon is the party the responds. In some cases it is easy
to distinguish the client and the daemon, while in other cases it is a
bit trickier. 

Condor tools such as \condor{submit} and \condor{config\_val} are
client tools. They communicate with daemons: the \condor{submit}
command communicates with the \condor{schedd}, while the
\condor{config\_val} command may communicate with any Condor daemon. 

Behind the scenes, Condor daemons also communicate with each
other. For instance, the \condor{negotiator} will act as a client and
contact the \condor{schedd} daemon to initiate matchmaking. When a
match has been found, the \condor{schedd} will act as a client and
contact the \condor{startd} daemon. 

\subsubsection{\label{sec:security-negotiation} Security Negotiation}

When a daemon receives a request, it uses the client's security
configuration information together with its own configuration settings
to decide upon the security aspects of the communication.  This can be
considered a negotiation between the client and the daemon.  The
daemon replies to the client with a set of reconciled policies that
controls the communication, including authentication, encryption, and
integrity algorithms. For instance, if the client insists upon using
GSI authentication, while the daemon considers it optional, then GSI
authentication will be used. 

Note that this process is called security negotiation. Although it has
a similar name to the negotiation provided by the \condor{negotiator},
it is a completely independent process.

If the daemon determines that authentication is required, then the
client must follow the chosen authentication protocol.  After the
required authentication, the client can send its request to the
daemon.  The daemon identifies the access level required for the
specific request, and it checks the configuration settings to
determine if the client has the required access level.  If the client
has the required access level, permission is granted, and the request
is serviced.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:Security-access-levels}Access Level Descriptions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{security!access levels}
Authorization is granted based on specified access levels.
Access levels are granted for users by configuration settings.
The following describes the various access levels provided
by Condor.

\begin{description}

\item[\DCPerm{READ}] \label{sec-level-read} This access level
   access can obtain or read information about Condor.
   Examples that require only \DCPerm{READ} access are
   viewing the status of the pool with \Condor{status}, 
   checking a job queue with \Condor{q},
   or viewing user priorities with \Condor{userprio}.
   \DCPerm{READ} access does not allow any
   changes, and it does not allow job submission.

\item[\DCPerm{WRITE}] \label{sec-level-write} This access level is
   required to send (write) information to Condor. Examples that
   require \DCPerm{WRITE} access are job submission with
   \Condor{submit} and advertising a machine so it appears in the pool
   (this is usually done automatically by the \Condor{startd} daemon).
   Note that \DCPerm{WRITE} access does not imply \DCPerm{READ}
   access.  They are separate access levels and you can theoretically
   grant a user \DCPerm{WRITE} access without \DCPerm{READ} access.

\item[\DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR}] \label{sec-level-administrator} This
   access level has additional Condor
   administrator rights to the pool.  It includes the ability to
   change user priorities (with the command \Condor{userprio -set}),
   and the ability to turn Condor on and off
   (as with the commands \Condor{on} and \Condor{off}).

\item[\DCPerm{CONFIG}] \label{sec-level-config} This access level is
   required to modify a daemon's configuration using
   the \Condor{config\_val} command.
   By default, this level of access can
   change any configuration parameters of a Condor pool,
   except those specified in
   the \File{condor\_config.root} configuration file.

% commented out June 04, as it has not been implemented
%\item[\DCPerm{DAEMON}] \label{sec-level-daemon} 
%   This access level is only used by Condor daemons for internal
%   exchange of requests.
%   An example is the message sent from the \Condor{startd} daemon
%   to the \Condor{schedd} daemon in order to claim a resource.
%   In general, this level of access should be granted to all Condor
%   daemons, implying that this level of access should be granted
%   to the id under which the Condor daemons are run.

\item[\DCPerm{OWNER}] \label{sec-level-owner} This level of access is
   required for commands that the owner of a machine (any local user)
   should be able to use, in addition to the Condor administrators.
   An example that requires the \DCPerm{OWNER} access level is
   the \Condor{vacate} command.
   The command causes the \Condor{startd} daemon to vacate any
   Condor job currently running on a machine.
   The owner of that machine should be able to cause the removal
   of a job running on the machine.

\item[\DCPerm{NEGOTIATOR}] \label{sec-level-negotiator} This 
   access level is used specifically to verify that commands are
   sent by the \Condor{negotiator} daemon.
   The \Condor{negotiator} daemon runs on the central manager of
   the pool.
   Commands requiring this access
   level are the ones that tell the \Condor{schedd} daemon to begin
   negotiating, and those that tell an available \Condor{startd} daemon
   that it has been matched to a \Condor{schedd} with jobs to run.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:Security-NamesValues} Security Macro Names and Values}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

There are a large number of security configuration macros. Fortunately
you can usually deal with a small subset. In addition, most
configuration macros follow a pattern:
\begin{verbatim}
    SEC_<access-level>_<type>
\end{verbatim}
Where the access-level is one of of the access levels defined in
Section~\ref{sec:Security-access-levels}: 
\begin{verbatim}
    DEFAULT
    READ
    WRITE
    ADMINISTRATOR
    CONFIG
    OWNER
    NEGOTIATOR
    CLIENT
\end{verbatim}
% commented out June 04, as it has not been implemented
%   DAEMON

Note that both \MacroNI{CLIENT} and \MacroNI{DEFAULT} 
from this list are not actually access levels.
The \MacroNI{CLIENT} is used to define the client's requirements
and preferences in a secure communication.
The \MacroNI{DEFAULT} is used to define all levels of access
for a specific configuration variable when individual levels
are not specified. 
This can sometimes be used in place of using any of
the other access levels, if it's okay for all of them to be the same. 
Note that if \MacroNI{DEFAULT} is used in combination with another
access level, then \MacroNI{DEFAULT} will apply in all cases, except
for that access level. 

The type describes is one of:
\begin{verbatim}
    AUTHENTICATION
    ENCRYPTION
    INTEGRITY
    NEGOTIATION
\end{verbatim}
Two examples of the complete macro names are
\MacroNI{SEC\_ADMINISTRATOR\_AUTHENTICATION}
and
\MacroNI{SEC\_DEFAULT\_INTEGRITY}.

Each configuration variable would be defined with one
of four predefined values.
The values are
\begin{verbatim}
    REQUIRED
    PREFERRED
    OPTIONAL
    NEVER 
\end{verbatim}
For example, a line in a daemon's configuration file
to require all interactions to be encrypted is
\begin{verbatim}
    SEC_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION = REQUIRED
\end{verbatim}
A second example from a configuration file specifies that all
requests (from a client) that would require a \MacroNI{WRITE}
access level be authenticated is
\begin{verbatim}
    SEC_WRITE_AUTHENTICATION = REQUIRED
\end{verbatim}

A daemon uses both the client's security configuration
together with its own configuration to choose the communication
setting
for authentication, encryption, or integrity check.
The following table defines whether or not (Yes or No) a
communication setting will be used, or if the setting cannot
work (Fail) due to a mismatch in the configuration settings.

\begin{verbatim}

Here are three examples:

Example 1: If a user submits a job with \condor{submit} and has
\verb@SEC_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = OPTIONAL@ and the \condor{schedd}
has \verb@SEC_WRITE_AUTHENTICATION = REQUIRED@ then authentication
will be required to submit job. 

Example 2: If the configuration file only contains
\verb@SEC_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION = REQUIRED@ then authentication will
be used for all communication. 

Example 3: If a user's configuration specifies
\verb@SEC_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION = NEVER@ while the
\condor{collector}'s configuration specifes
\verb@SEC_READ_AUTHENTICATION = REQUIRED@, then the user will be
unable to run the \condor{status} command.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:Security-sample1} Example of Daemon-Side Security Configuration}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A configuration file is provided when Condor is installed.
No security features are enabled within the configuration as
distributed.
Included as comments within the configuration file is an example 
suggesting settings that enable security features.
Here is that example of the daemon-side portion.

% from Zach  (3/7/03)
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
SEC_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION         = REQUIRED
SEC_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION             = REQUIRED
SEC_DEFAULT_INTEGRITY              = REQUIRED

SEC_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS = KERBEROS, FS
SEC_DEFAULT_CRYPTO_METHODS         = 3DES, BLOWFISH
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This set of configuration macros forces security features
to be used at all times.
All communication is authenticated with Kerberos, unless the client
does not use Kerberos but supports filesystem authentication, in
which case filesystem authentication is used.
All communication is both encrypted integrity checked to make sure
that messages are not modified or corrupted. 
The encryption is preferably with triple DES, but Blowfish will be
used if the client does not use Kerberos but does use Blowfish.

Security negotiation configuration variables are not included in this
suggested configuration.
The default (when undefined) will be to set
\begin{verbatim}
SEC_DEFAULT_NEGOTIATION=OPTIONAL
\end{verbatim}

Note that this example configuration requires that all Condor daemons be
version 6.3.3 or later, since previous versions will not have
the ability to do secure communication.

\subsubsection{Configuring Authentication}

The client uses one of two macros to configure authentication:
\index{SEC\_DEFAULT\_AUTHENTICATION macro@\texttt{SEC\_DEFAULT\_AUTHENTICATION} macro}
\index{configuration macro!\texttt{SEC\_DEFAULT\_AUTHENTICATION}}
\index{SEC\_CLIENT\_AUTHENTICATION macro@\texttt{SEC\_CLIENT\_AUTHENTICATION} macro}
\index{configuration macro!\texttt{SEC\_CLIENT\_AUTHENTICATION}}
\begin{verbatim}
    SEC_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION
    SEC_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION
\end{verbatim}

For the daemon, there are seven macros to configure authentication:
\index{SEC\_READ\_AUTHENTICATION macro@\texttt{SEC\_READ\_AUTHENTICATION} macro}
\index{configuration macro!\texttt{SEC\_READ\_AUTHENTICATION}}
\index{SEC\_WRITE\_AUTHENTICATION macro@\texttt{SEC\_WRITE\_AUTHENTICATION} macro}
\index{configuration macro!\texttt{SEC\_WRITE\_AUTHENTICATION}}
\index{SEC\_ADMINISTRATOR\_AUTHENTICATION macro@\texttt{SEC\_ADMINISTRATOR\_AUTHENTICATION} macro}
\index{configuration macro!\texttt{SEC\_ADMINISTRATOR\_AUTHENTICATION}}

\begin{verbatim}

    SEC_READ_AUTHENTICATION
    SEC_WRITE_AUTHENTICATION
    SEC_ADMINISTRATOR_AUTHENTICATION
    SEC_CONFIG_AUTHENTICATION
    SEC_OWNER_AUTHENTICATION
    SEC_NEGOTIATOR_AUTHENTICATION
\end{verbatim}
% commented out June 04, as it has not been implemented
%   SEC_DAEMON_AUTHENTICATION

As an example, the macro defined in the configuration file
for a daemon as
\begin{verbatim}
SEC_WRITE_AUTHENTICATION = REQUIRED
\end{verbatim}
signifies that the daemon must authenticate the client for
any communication that requires the \DCPerm{WRITE} access level.
If the daemon's configuration contains
\begin{verbatim}
SEC_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION = REQUIRED
\end{verbatim}
and does not contain any other security configuration for
\verb@AUTHENTICATION@, then this default defines the daemon's needs
for authentication over all access levels.
Where a specific macro is present, its value takes
precedence over any default given.


If authentication is to be done, then the communicating parties
must negotiate a mutually acceptable method of
authentication to be used.
A list of acceptable methods may be provided by the client, using the
macros
\index{SEC\_DEFAULT\_AUTHENTICATION\_METHODS macro@\texttt{SEC\_DEFAULT\_AUTHENTICATION\_METHODS} macro}
\index{configuration macro!\texttt{SEC\_DEFAULT\_AUTHENTICATION\_METHODS}}
\index{SEC\_CLIENT\_AUTHENTICATION\_METHODS macro@\texttt{SEC\_CLIENT\_AUTHENTICATION\_METHODS} macro}
\index{configuration macro!\texttt{SEC\_CLIENT\_AUTHENTICATION\_METHODS}}
\begin{verbatim}
    SEC_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS
    SEC_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS
\end{verbatim}
A list of acceptable methods may be provided by the daemon, using the
macros
\index{SEC\_DEFAULT\_AUTHENTICATION\_METHODS macro@\texttt{SEC\_DEFAULT\_AUTHENTICATION\_METHODS} macro}
\index{configuration macro!\texttt{SEC\_DEFAULT\_AUTHENTICATION\_METHODS}}
\index{SEC\_READ\_AUTHENTICATION\_METHODS macro@\texttt{SEC\_READ\_AUTHENTICATION\_METHODS} macro}

    SEC_WRITE_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS
    SEC_ADMINISTRATOR_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS
    SEC_CONFIG_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS
    SEC_OWNER_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS
    SEC_NEGOTIATOR_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS
\end{verbatim}
% commented out June 04, as it has not been implemented
%   SEC_DAEMON_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS
The methods are
given as a comma-separated list of acceptable values.
These variables list the authentication methods that are available
to be used.
The ordering of the list gives preference;
the first item in the list indicates the highest preference.
The values will be 
\begin{verbatim}
    GSI
    KERBEROS
    FS
    FS_REMOTE
    NTSSPI
    CLAIMTOBE
    ANONYMOUS
\end{verbatim}
%   PASSWORD

As an example, the macro
% \begin{verbatim}
% SEC_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS = KERBEROS, GSI
% \end{verbatim}
% indicates that either Kerberos or the Globus Security Infrastructure
% (GSI) authentication may be used,
% but Kerberos is preferred over GSI.
\begin{verbatim}
SEC_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS = KERBEROS, NTSSPI
\end{verbatim}
indicates that either Kerberos or Windows authentication may be used,
but Kerberos is preferred over Windows.
Note that if the client and daemon agree that multiple authentication
methods may be used, then they are tried in turn. For instance, if
they both agree that Kerberos or NTSSPI may be used, then Kerberos
will be tried first, and if there is a failure for any reason, then
NTSSPI will be tried. 

\subsubsection{Authentication Defaults}

By default, all of the \verb@SEC_<access-level>_AUTHENTICATION@ are
\verb@OPTIONAL@, except for operations which modify the job queue (like
\condor{q} and \condor{rm}) which are \verb@REQUIRED@.

By default on Unix, the authentication methods are ``\verb@FS@, \verb@KERBEROS@,
\verb@GSI@'', while on Windows they are ``\verb@NTSSPI@, \verb@KERBEROS@, \verb@GSI@''. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:GSI-Authentication}GSI Authentication}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{authentication!GSI}
The GSI (Grid Security Infrastructure) protocol provides
an avenue for Condor to do
PKI-based (Public Key Infrastructure) authentication using X.509
certificates. 
The basics of GSI are well-documented elsewhere, such as
\URL{http://www.globus.org/}. 

A simple introduction to this type of authentication
defines Condor's use of terminology,
and it illuminates the needed items that Condor must access to
do authentication.
Assume that 
A authenticates to B.
In this example, A is the client, and B is the server.
For Condor's purposes, both the client and the server
will either be a daemon
or a user (running a Condor command such as \Condor{status}).
This example's one-way authentication implies that B
is verifying the identity of A,
using the certificate A provides,
together with B's own set of trusted CAs (Certification Authorities).
Client A provides its certificate (or proxy) to server B.
B does two things:
B checks that the certificate is valid,
and B checks to see that the CA that signed A's certificate
is one that B trusts.

For this specific authentication protocol,
an X.509 certificate is required.
\index{certificate!X.509}
Files with predetermined names hold a certificate,
a key, and optionally, a proxy.
A separate directory has one or more files, each of which contains
a trusted CA.

Allowing Condor to do this GSI authentication
requires knowledge of the locations of
the client-side certificate and the server-side list of
trusted CAs.
For a Condor daemon, these locations are determined
by configuration or by default locations.
For a user, these locations are determined by the
pre-set values of environment variables or by default locations.

\begin{description}
\item[Server side Configuration]

For a Condor daemon, the certificate may be a single host certificate,
\index{host certificate}
and all Condor daemons on the same machine may share the same certificate.
In some cases, the certificate can also be copied to other machines,
where local copies are necessary.
This can only be done in cases where a single host certificate can
match multiple host names, something that is beyond the scope of this
manual. 
The certificates must be protected by access rights to files,
since the password file is not encrypted.

%Condor users (those who submit jobs) can also use
%the X.509-based authentication.
%These users must also
%have valid X.509 certificates signed by a trusted CA.
%For use when submitting jobs,
%the certificate is used to generate a proxy:
%\index{proxy}
%a combination of certificate and password that is valid only
%for a specific (and usually short) time period.
%A proxy is used so that the user does  
%not need to be present (to give a password) when a job is executed.

The specification of the location of the necessary files
through configuration uses the following precedence.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Configuration variable \Macro{GSI\_DAEMON\_DIRECTORY} gives the complete
path name to the directory that contains the certificate, key,
and directory with trusted CAs.
Condor uses this directory as follows in its construction of the following
configuration variables:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
GSI_DAEMON_CERT           = $(GSI_DAEMON_DIR)/hostcert.pem
GSI_DAEMON_KEY            = $(GSI_DAEMON_DIR)/hostkey.pem 
GSI_DAEMON_TRUSTED_CA_DIR = $(GSI_DAEMON_DIR)/certificates 
\end{verbatim}

\normalsize
Note that no proxy is assumed in this case.
\item
If the \MacroNI{GSI\_DAEMON\_DIRECTORY} is not defined, 
or when defined,
the location may be overridden with specific configuration
variables that specify the complete path and filename of 
the certificate with
  \begin{description}
  \item{\Macro{GSI\_DAEMON\_CERT}}
  \end{description}
the key with
  \begin{description}
  \item{\Macro{GSI\_DAEMON\_KEY}}
  \end{description}
a proxy with
  \begin{description}
  \item{\Macro{GSI\_DAEMON\_PROXY}}
  \end{description}
the complete path to the directory containing the list of trusted CAs with 
  \begin{description}
  \item{\Macro{GSI\_DAEMON\_TRUSTED\_CA\_DIR}}
  \end{description}
\item
The default location assumed is \File{/etc/grid-security}.
Note that this implemented by setting the value of  
\MacroNI{GSI\_DAEMON\_DIRECTORY}.
\end{enumerate}

Here is an example portion of the configuration file that would
enable and require GSI authentication,
along with a minimal set of other variables to make it work. 
Note that the last entry (\MacroNI{GSI\_DAEMON\_NAME}) in this example
must be on a single line;
this example is broken onto two lines for formatting reasons.

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
SEC_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION = REQUIRED
SEC_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS = GSI
GSI_DAEMON_DIRECTORY = /path/to/daemon/credential.location
GSI_DAEMON_NAME = /C=US/O=Condor/O=University of Wisconsin
/OU=Computer Sciences Department/CN=condor@cs.wisc.edu
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The
\MacroNI{SEC\_DEFAULT\_AUTHENTICATION} macro specifies that
authentication is required for all communications.
This single macro covers all communications, but could be
replaced with a set of macros that require authentication for
only specific communications.
See section~\ref{sec:Security-Authentication} for details on the
more specific configuration variables used for authentication.

In this example, only the \MacroNI{GSI} method can be used. 
If another methods is acceptable (perhaps \MacroNI{KERBEROS}, then
placing this method first within the list will cause Condor to give
preference to this method over GSI, or vice-versa. 

The macro \MacroNI{GSI\_DAEMON\_DIRECTORY} is specified
to give
Condor a single place to find the daemon's certificate.
This path may be a directory or a shared file system such as AFS. 
Alternatively, this path name can point to 
local copies of the certificate stored
in a local file system.


\item[User side Set Up]

The user specifies the location of a certificate, proxy, etc.
in one of two ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Environment variables give the location of necessary items.
  \begin{description}
  \item{\Env{X509\_USER\_PROXY} gives the path and file name of the proxy.
  This proxy will have been created using the \Prog{grid-proxy-init} program, 
  which will place the proxy in the \File{/tmp}
  directory with the file name being determined by the format:
  \begin{verbatim}
  /tmp/x509up_uXXXX
  \end{verbatim}
  The specific file name is given by substituting the \verb@XXXX@
  characters with the UID of the user.
  Note that when a valid proxy is used, the certificate and key locations
  are not needed.  }
  \item{\Env{X509\_USER\_CERT} gives the path and file name of the
  certificate. It is also used if a proxy location has been checked,
  but the proxy is no longer valid.  }
  \item{\Env{X509\_USER\_KEY} gives the path and file name of the
  key. Note that most keys are password encrypted, such that knowing
  the location could not lead to using the key.  }
  \item{\Env{X509\_CERT\_DIR} gives the path to the directory 
  containing the list of trusted CAs. }
  \end{description}

\item
Without environment variables to give locations of necessary
certificate information,
Condor uses a default directory for the user.
This directory is given by 
\begin{verbatim}
$(HOME)/.globus
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

When a daemon acts as the client within authentication,
the daemon needs a listing of those from which it
will accept certificates.

The macro \MacroNI{GSI\_DAEMON\_NAME} configuration macro
provides daemons with a distinguished name to use for
X.509 authentication.
This name is specified with the following format
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
GSI_DAEMON_NAME = /C=?/O=?/O=?/OU=?/CN=<daemon_name@domain>
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
A complete example that has the question marks filled in and the
daemon's user name filled in is given in the 
example configuration above.

Condor will also need a way to map an X.509 distinguished
name to a Condor user id.
This is done in an administrator-maintained file called an X.509 map file,
mapping from X509 Distinguished Name (DN) to Condor user id.
It is similar to a Globus gridmap file except that it is only used for
mapping to a user id, not for authorization. 
Information about authorization can be found in
Section~\ref{sec:Security-Authorization}. 
Entries (lines) in the file each contain two items.
The first item in an entry is the 
X.509 certificate subject name, and it is enclosed in quotes
(using the character \verb@"@).
The second item is the Condor user id.
The two items in an entry are separated by tab or space character(s).
Here is an example of an entry in an X.509 map file.
Entries must be on a single line; this example is broken
onto two lines for formatting reasons.

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
"/C=US/O=Globus/O=University of Wisconsin/
OU=Computer Sciences Department/CN=Alice Smith" asmith
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Condor finds the map file in one of three ways.
If the configuration variable \Macro{GRIDMAP} is defined,
it gives the full path name to the map file.
When not defined,
Condor looks for the map file in 
\begin{verbatim}
$(GSI_DAEMON_DIRECTORY)/grid-mapfile
\end{verbatim}
If \Macro{GSI\_DAEMON\_DIRECTORY} is not defined,
then the third place Condor looks for the map file is given by
\begin{verbatim}
/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile
\end{verbatim}

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:Kerberos-Authentication}Kerberos Authentication}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{authentication!Kerberos}
If Kerberos is used for authentication, then 
the configuration variable
\Macro{KERBEROS\_MAP\_FILE}
is used to define a path to an administrator-maintained file that
contains Kerberos domain (called a realm) to Condor UID domain mapping.
The configuration syntax is
\begin{verbatim}
KERBEROS_MAP_FILE = /path/to/etc/condor.kmap
\end{verbatim}

Lines within the map file have the syntax
\begin{verbatim}
   KERB.REALM = UID.domain.name
\end{verbatim}

Here are two lines from a map file to use as an example:
\begin{verbatim}
   CS.WISC.EDU   = cs.wisc.edu
   ENGR.WISC.EDU = ee.wisc.edu
\end{verbatim}

If a \MacroNI{KERBEROS\_MAP\_FILE}
configuration variable is defined and set,
then all permitted realms must be explicitly mapped.
If no map file is specified, then Condor assumes that the
Kerberos realm is the same as the Condor UID domain.

The configuration variable
\Macro{CONDOR\_SERVER\_PRINCIPAL}
defines the name of a Kerberos principal.
If \MacroNI{CONDOR\_SERVER\_PRINCIPAL} is not defined,
then the default value used is "host".
A principal specifies a unique name to which a set of credentials
may be assigned.
\index{authentication!Kerberos principal}

Condor takes the specified (or default) principal and appends
a slash character, the host name, an '@' (at sign character),
and the Kerberos realm.
As an example, the configuration
\begin{verbatim}
CONDOR_SERVER_PRINCIPAL = condor-daemon
\end{verbatim}
results in Condor's use of
\begin{verbatim}
condor-daemon/the.host.name@YOUR.KERB.REALM
\end{verbatim}
as the server principal.

Here is
an example of configuration settings that use Kerberos for
authentication and require authentication of all communications
of the write or administrator access level.
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
SEC_WRITE_AUTHENTICATION                 = REQUIRED
SEC_WRITE_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS         = KERBEROS
SEC_ADMINISTRATOR_AUTHENTICATION         = REQUIRED
SEC_ADMINISTRATOR_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS = KERBEROS
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:FS-Authentication}File System Authentication}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{authentication!using a file system}
This form of authentication utilizes the ownership of a file
in the identity verification of a client.
A daemon authenticating a client requires the client to write
a file in a specific location (\File{/tmp}).
The daemon then checks the ownership of the file.
The file's ownership verifies the identity of the client.
In this way, the file system becomes the trusted authority.
This authentication method is only appropriate for clients and daemons
that are on the same computer. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:FSR-Authentication}File System Remote Authentication}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{authentication!using a remote file system}
Like file system authentication,
this form of authentication utilizes the ownership of a file
in the identity verification of a client.
In this case,
a daemon authenticating a client requires the client to write
a file in a specific location,
but the location is not restricted to \File{/tmp}.
The location of the file is specified by the configuration
variable \Macro{FS\_REMOTE\_DIR}.

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \index{authentication!using a password}
% Authentication can be done interactively.
% This method of authentication can only be used for verifying the
% identity of a client.
% It requires a command line ?,
% and the client is prompted for a password.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:NTSSPI-Authentication}Windows Authentication}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{authentication!Windows}
This authentication is done only among Windows machines using
a proprietary method.
The Windows security interface SSPI is used to enforce NTLM
(NT LAN Manager).
The authentication is based on challenge and response, using the user's
password as a key.
This is similar to Kerberos.
The main difference 
is that Kerberos provides an access token that typically grants
access to an entire network, whereas NTLM authentication only 
verifies an identity to one machine at a time.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:CLAIM-Authentication}Claim To Be Authentication}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Claim To Be authentication accepts any identity claimed by the client.
As such, it does not authenticate.
It is included in Condor and in the list of authentication methods
for testing purposes only.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:ANON-Authentication}Anonymous Authentication}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Anonymous authentication causes authentication to be skipped entirely.
As such, it does not authenticate.
It is included in Condor and in the list of authentication methods
for testing purposes only.

\subsection{\label{sec:Security-Authorization}Authorization}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{security!authorization}
\index{authorization!for security}
\index{security!based on user authorization}

Authorization protects resource usage by granting or denying
access requests made to the resources.
It defines who is allowed to do what.

Authorization is defined in terms of users.
An initial implementation provided authorization
based on hosts (machines), while the current implementation
relies on user-based authorization.
Section~\ref{sec:Host-Security}
on Setting Up IP/Host-Based Security in Condor describes the
previous implementation.
This IP/Host-Based security still exists, and it can be used,
but significantly stronger and more flexible
security can be achieved with the newer
authorization based on fully qualified user names.
In this section, we will just discussion user-based authorization. 

% format for the configuration macro index entries
%\index{ macro@\texttt{} macro}
%\index{configuration macro!\texttt{}}

Unlike authentication, encryption, and integrity checks,
which can be configured by both client and server,
authorization is used only by a server.
The authorization portion of the security of a Condor pool is
based on a set of configuration macros.
The macros list which user/daemon will be authorized
to issue what request given a specific access level.

These configuration macros define a set of users that will be
allowed to (or denied from) carrying out various Condor commands.
Each access level may have its own list of authorized users.

\end{verbatim}
% commented out June 04, as it has not been implemented
%   ALLOW_DAEMON
%   DENY_DAEMON

Each macro is defined by a comma-separated list of fully qualified
users.
Each
fully qualified user
is described using the following format:
\begin{verbatim}
    username@domain/hostname
\end{verbatim}
The information to the left of the slash character describes
a user within a domain.
The information to the right of the slash character describes
one or more machines from which the user would be issuing a command. 
This host name may take the form of either a fully qualified host name
of the form
\begin{verbatim}
bird.cs.wisc.edu
\end{verbatim}
or an IP address
of the form
\begin{verbatim}
128.105.128.0
\end{verbatim}

An example is
\begin{verbatim}
zmiller@cs.wisc.edu/bird.cs.wisc.edu
\end{verbatim}

Within the format, wild card characters (the asterisk, *) are allowed.
The use of wild cards is limited to one wild card on either side
of the slash character.
A wild card character used in the host name is further limited
to come at the beginning of a fully qualified host name
or at the end of an IP address.
For example,
\begin{verbatim}
*@cs.wisc.edu/bird.cs.wisc.edu
\end{verbatim}
refers to any user that comes from \verb@cs.wisc.edu@,
where the command is originating from the machine
\verb@bird.cs.wisc.edu@.
Another valid example,
\begin{verbatim}
zmiller@cs.wisc.edu/*.cs.wisc.edu
\end{verbatim}
refers to commands coming from any machine within the 
\verb@cs.wisc.edu@ domain, and issued by \verb@zmiller@.
A third valid example,
\begin{verbatim}
*@cs.wisc.edu/*
\end{verbatim}
refers to commands coming from any user within the 
\verb@cs.wisc.edu@ domain
where the command is issued from any machine.
A fourth valid example,
\begin{verbatim}
*@cs.wisc.edu/128.105.*
\end{verbatim}
refers to commands coming from any user within the 
\verb@cs.wisc.edu@ domain
where the command is issued from machines within the network that match
the first two octets of the IP address.

If the set of machines is specified by an IP address,
then further specification using a net mask
identifies a physical set (subnet) of machines.
This physical set of machines is specified using the form
\begin{verbatim}
network/netmask
\end{verbatim}
The \verb@network@ is an IP address.
The net mask takes one of two forms.
It may be a decimal number which refers to the number of leading
bits of the IP address that are used in describing a subnet.
Or, the net mask may take the form of
\begin{verbatim}
a.b.c.d
\end{verbatim}
where \verb@a@,
\verb@b@,
\verb@c@, and
\verb@d@
are decimal numbers that each specify an 8-bit mask.
An example net mask is
\begin{verbatim}
255.255.192.0
\end{verbatim}
which specifies the bit mask
\begin{verbatim}
11111111.11111111.11000000.00000000
\end{verbatim}

A single complete example of a configuration variable that uses
a net mask is
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
ALLOW_WRITE = joesmith@cs.wisc.edu/128.105.128.0/17
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
User \verb@joesmith@ within the
\verb@cs.wisc.edu@ domain is given write authorization
when originating from machines that match their leftmost
17 bits of the IP address.

This flexible set of configuration macros could used to define
conflicting authorization.
Therefore, the following protocol defines the precedence of the
configuration macros.
\begin{description}
\item{1. }\MacroNI{DENY\_*} macros take precedence over \Macro{ALLOW\_* macros}
where there is a conflict.
This implies that if a specific user is both denied and granted authorization,
the conflict is resolved by denying access.
\item{2. }If macros are omitted, the default behavior is to grant
authorization for every user.
\end{description}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:Security-sample2} Example of Authorization Security Configuration}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

An example of the configuration variables for the user-side
authorization is derived from the necessary access levels
as described in
Section~\ref{sec:Security-access-levels}.

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
ALLOW_READ            = *@cs.wisc.edu/*
ALLOW_WRITE           = *@cs.wisc.edu/*.cs.wisc.edu
ALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR   = condor-admin@cs.wisc.edu/*.cs.wisc.edu
ALLOW_NEGOTIATOR      = condor@cs.wisc.edu/$(NEGOTIATOR_HOST)
ALLOW_CONFIG          = condor-admin@cs.wisc.edu/*.cs.wisc.edu
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
% commented out June 04, as it has not been implemented
%ALLOW_DAEMON          = condor@cs.wisc.edu/*.cs.wisc.edu

This example configuration authorizes
any user in the 
\verb@cs.wisc.edu@ domain to 
carry out a request that requires the 
\DCPerm{READ} access level
from any machine.
Any user in the 
\verb@cs.wisc.edu@ domain may 
carry out a request that requires the 
\DCPerm{WRITE} access level
from any machine in the
\verb@cs.wisc.edu@ domain.
Only the user called \verb@condor-admin@ may 
carry out a request that requires the 
\DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR} access level
from any machine in the
\verb@cs.wisc.edu@ domain.
Only the negotiator daemon, running as
\verb@condor@ on the machine defined by the
\MacroNI{NEGOTIATOR\_HOST} macro is authorized 
with the
\DCPerm{NEGOTIATOR} access level.
The administrator, logged into any machine within
the \verb@cs.wisc.edu@ domain is authorized at the
\DCPerm{CONFIG} access level.
And, the last line of the example presumes that there is a
user called condor, and that the daemons have all been started
up as this user.
% commented out June 04, as it has not been implemented
%It authorizes only programs (which will be the daemons)
%running as 
%\verb@condor@ to
%carry out requests that require the 
%\DCPerm{DAEMON} access level,
%where the commands originate from
%any machine in the
%\verb@cs.wisc.edu@ domain.

In the local configuration file for each host, the host's
owner should be authorized
as the owner of the machine.
An example of the entry in the local configuration file:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
ALLOW_OWNER           = username@cs.wisc.edu/hostname.cs.wisc.edu
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
In this example the owner has a login of
\verb@username@, and the machine's name is represented by
\verb@hostname@.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Security-Encryption}Encryption}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{security!encryption}
Encryption provides privacy support between two communicating parties.
Through configuration macros, both the client and the daemon
can specify whether encryption is required for further communication.

The client uses one of two macros to enable or disable encryption:
\index{SEC\_DEFAULT\_ENCRYPTION macro@\texttt{SEC\_DEFAULT\_ENCRYPTION} macro}
\index{configuration macro!\texttt{SEC\_DEFAULT\_ENCRYPTION}}
\index{SEC\_CLIENT\_ENCRYPTION macro@\texttt{SEC\_CLIENT\_ENCRYPTION} macro}
\index{configuration macro!\texttt{SEC\_CLIENT\_ENCRYPTION}}
\begin{verbatim}
    SEC_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION
    SEC_CLIENT_ENCRYPTION
\end{verbatim}

For the daemon, there are seven macros to enable or disable encryption:
\index{SEC\_DEFAULT\_ENCRYPTION macro@\texttt{SEC\_DEFAULT\_ENCRYPTION} macro}
\index{configuration macro!\texttt{SEC\_DEFAULT\_ENCRYPTION}}
\index{SEC\_READ\_ENCRYPTION macro@\texttt{SEC\_READ\_ENCRYPTION} macro}

    SEC_OWNER_ENCRYPTION
    SEC_NEGOTIATOR_ENCRYPTION
\end{verbatim}
% commented out June 04, as it has not been implemented
%   SEC_DAEMON_ENCRYPTION

As an example, the macro defined in the configuration file
for a daemon as
\begin{verbatim}
SEC_CONFIG_ENCRYPTION = REQUIRED
\end{verbatim}
signifies that any communication that changes a daemon's configuration
must be encrypted.
If a daemon's configuration contains
\begin{verbatim}
SEC_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION = REQUIRED
\end{verbatim}
and does not contain any other security configuration for
ENCRYPTION, then this default defines the daemon's needs
for encryption over all access levels.
Where a specific macro is present, its value takes
precedence over any default given.

If encryption is to be done, then the communicating parties
must find (negotiate) a mutually acceptable method of
encryption to be used.
A list of acceptable methods may be provided by the client, using the
macros
\index{SEC\_DEFAULT\_CRYPTO\_METHODS macro@\texttt{SEC\_DEFAULT\_CRYPTO\_METHODS} macro}
\index{configuration macro!\texttt{SEC\_DEFAULT\_CRYPTO\_METHODS}}
\index{SEC\_CLIENT\_CRYPTO\_METHODS macro@\texttt{SEC\_CLIENT\_CRYPTO\_METHODS} macro}

\end{verbatim}
% commented out June 04, as it has not been implemented

The methods are
given as a comma-separated list of acceptable values.
These variables list the encryption methods that are available
to be used.
The ordering of the list gives preference;
the first item in the list indicates the highest preference.
Possible values are
\begin{verbatim}
    3DES
    BLOWFISH
\end{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Security-Integrity}Integrity}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{security!integrity}

An integrity check assures that the messages between communicating parties
have not been tampered with.
Any change, such as addition, modification, or deletion can
be detected.
Through configuration macros, both the client and the daemon
can specify whether an integrity check is required of further communication.

The client uses one of two macros to enable or disable an integrity check:
\index{SEC\_DEFAULT\_INTEGRITY macro@\texttt{SEC\_DEFAULT\_INTEGRITY} macro}
\index{configuration macro!\texttt{SEC\_DEFAULT\_INTEGRITY}}
\index{SEC\_CLIENT\_INTEGRITY macro@\texttt{SEC\_CLIENT\_INTEGRITY} macro}
\index{configuration macro!\texttt{SEC\_CLIENT\_INTEGRITY}}
\begin{verbatim}

    SEC_OWNER_INTEGRITY
    SEC_NEGOTIATOR_INTEGRITY
\end{verbatim}
% commented out June 04, as it has not been implemented
%   SEC_DAEMON_INTEGRITY

As an example, the macro defined in the configuration file
for a daemon as
\begin{verbatim}
SEC_CONFIG_INTEGRITY = REQUIRED
\end{verbatim}
signifies that any communication that changes a daemon's configuration
must have its integrity assured.
If a daemon's configuration contains
\begin{verbatim}
SEC_DEFAULT_INTEGRITY = REQUIRED
\end{verbatim}
and does not contain any other security configuration for
\verb@INTEGRITY@, then this default defines the daemon's needs
for integrity checks over all access levels.
Where a specific macro is present, its value takes
precedence over any default given.

There is currently only one method used for integrity checking:
a signed MD5 checksum.
Its use is implied whenever integrity checks occur.
If more methods are implemented, then there will be further
macros to allow both the client and the daemon to specify
which methods are acceptable.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Host-Security}Host-Based Security in
Condor} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{security!host-based}

This section describes the mechanisms for setting up Condor's
host-based security.  
This is now an outdated form of implementing security at
the level of machine access. 
It remains available and documented for purposes of backward compatibility.
If used at the same time as the user-based authorization,
the two specifications are merged together.

The host-based security allows control over what machines can
join a Condor pool, what machines can find out information about
your pool, and what machines within your pool can perform
administrative commands.  By default, Condor is configured to allow
anyone to view or join your pool.  You probably want to change that.

This section discusses how the host-based security works inside Condor.
It lists the different levels of access and what
parts of Condor use which levels.
There is a description of how to configure
your pool to grant (or deny) certain levels of access to various
machines.
Configuration examples and the settings of configuration variables
using the \Condor{config\_val} command complete this section.

Inside the Condor daemons or tools that use DaemonCore (see
section~\ref{sec:DaemonCore} for details), most
things are accomplished by sending commands to another Condor daemon.
These commands are formed from an integer to specify which command,
followed
by any optional information that the protocol requires at that point
(such as a ClassAd, capability string, etc).
When the daemons start up,
they register which commands they are willing to accept, what to
do with arriving commands, and the access level required for
that command.
When a command arrives, Condor identifies the  access level
required, and checks the IP address of the sender to be
sure it passes the various allow/deny settings
in the configuration file for the given access level.
If permission is granted, the command continues. 
If not, the command is aborted.
%% What does it mean for a command to be aborted?  Is it just
%% thrown away (ignored), or is a reply sent indicating failure?

As expected, settings for the access levels in the global
configuration file affect all the machines in the pool.
Settings in a local configuration file only affect the specific machine.
The settings for a given machine determine what other hosts can send
commands to that machine.
So, if machine foo is to be given 
administrator access on machine bar, place foo in
bar's configuration file access list (not the other way around).


The following are the various access levels that commands within
Condor can be registered with:

\begin{description}

\item[\DCPerm{READ}] \label{dcperm:read} Machines with \DCPerm{READ}
   access can read information from Condor.  For example, they can
   view the status of the pool, see the job queue(s) or view user
   permissions.  \DCPerm{READ} access does not allow a machine to
   change anything, and it does not allow
   job submission. A machine listed
   with \DCPerm{READ} permission cannot join a Condor pool; the machine can
   only view information about the pool.

\item[\DCPerm{WRITE}] \label{dcperm:write} Machines with
   \DCPerm{WRITE} access can write information to Condor.
   Most notably, a machine can join a pool by sending ClassAd
   updates to the central manager. 
   The machine can talk to the other machines
   in a pool in order to submit or run jobs.
   In addition, any machine with
   \DCPerm{WRITE} access can request the \Condor{startd} daemon to perform a
   periodic checkpoint on a currently executing job. After a
   periodic checkpoint, the job will continue to execute, and the
   machine will still be claimed by whatever \Condor{schedd} daemon had claimed it.
   This allows users on the machines where they submitted their jobs
   to use the \Condor{checkpoint} command to get their jobs to
   periodically checkpoint, even if the users do not have an account on the
   machine where the jobs execute.

   \textbf{IMPORTANT:} For a machine to join a Condor pool, the machine must
   have both \DCPerm{WRITE} permission \textbf{AND} \DCPerm{READ} permission.
   \DCPerm{WRITE} permission is not enough.

\item[\DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR}] \label{dcperm:administrator} Machines
   with \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR} access have additional Condor
   administrator rights to the pool.  This includes the ability to
   change user priorities (with the command \Code{userprio -set}),
   and the ability to turn Condor on and off
   (with the command \Code{off \Sinful{machine}}).
   Typically, very few
   machines are in this list, perhaps only the workstations where the
   Condor administrators or system administrators work,
   or perhaps only the pool's central manager.

   \textbf{IMPORTANT:} This access is given to a machine,
   and it applies to an entire pool.
   So, \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR} access for a given machine provides
   \textbf{ANY USER} on that machine \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR}
   rights (including users who can run Condor jobs on that machine).
   Therefore, grant \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR} access carefully.

\item[\DCPerm{OWNER}] \label{dcperm:owner} This level of access is
   required for commands that the owner of a machine (any local user)
   should be able to use, in addition to the Condor administrators.
   For example, the \Condor{vacate} command causes the
   \Condor{startd} daemon to vacate any running Condor job.
   It requires \DCPerm{OWNER} permission,
   so that any user logged into a local machine
   can issue a \Condor{vacate} command.

\item[\DCPerm{NEGOTIATOR}] \label{dcperm:negotiator} This 
   access level is used specifically to verify that commands are
   sent by the \Condor{negotiator} daemon.
   The \Condor{negotiator} daemon runs on the central manager of
   the pool.
   Commands requiring this access
   level are the ones that tell the \Condor{schedd} daemon to begin
   negotiating, and those that tell an available \Condor{startd} daemon
   that it has been matched to a \Condor{schedd} with jobs to run.

\item[\DCPerm{CONFIG}] \label{dcperm:config} This access level is
   required to modify a daemon's configuration using
   the \Condor{config\_val} command.
   By default, machines with this level of access are able 
   to change any configuration parameters, except those specified in
   the \File{condor\_config.root} configuration file.
   Therefore, granting this level of host-wide access requires
   extreme caution.
   By default, \DCPerm{CONFIG} access is denied for all hosts.

\end{description}

Starting with version 6.3.2, Condor provides a mechanism for more
fine-grained control over the configuration settings that can be
modified remotely with \Condor{config\_val}.  

Host-based security access
permissions are specified in configuration files.

\DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR} and \DCPerm{NEGOTIATOR} access default to 
the central manager machine.
\DCPerm{OWNER} access defaults to the local machine, as well as
any machines
given with \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR} access.
\DCPerm{CONFIG} access is not granted to any machine
as its default.
These defaults work well, and should not be changed without
a compelling reason.
If machines other than the default are to have to have \DCPerm{OWNER}
access, they probably should also have \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR} access.
By granting machines \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR} access, they
will automatically have \DCPerm{OWNER} access, given how
\DCPerm{OWNER} access is set within the configuration.

The default access configuration is
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR = $(CONDOR_HOST)
HOSTALLOW_OWNER = $(FULL_HOSTNAME), $(HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR)
HOSTALLOW_READ = *
HOSTALLOW_WRITE = *
HOSTALLOW_NEGOTIATOR = $(NEGOTIATOR_HOST)
HOSTALLOW_NEGOTIATOR_SCHEDD = $(NEGOTIATOR_HOST), $(FLOCK_NEGOTIATOR_HOSTS)
HOSTALLOW_WRITE_COLLECTOR = $(HOSTALLOW_WRITE), $(FLOCK_FROM)
HOSTALLOW_WRITE_STARTD    = $(HOSTALLOW_WRITE), $(FLOCK_FROM)
HOSTALLOW_READ_COLLECTOR  = $(HOSTALLOW_READ), $(FLOCK_FROM)
HOSTALLOW_READ_STARTD     = $(HOSTALLOW_READ), $(FLOCK_FROM)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

For each access level, an ALLOW or a DENY may be added.
\begin{itemize}

\item If you have an ALLOW, it means "only allow these machines".  No
    ALLOW means allow anyone.

\item If you have a DENY, it means "deny these machines".  No DENY
    means to deny nobody.

\item If you have both an ALLOW and a DENY, it means allow the
    machines listed in ALLOW except for the machines listed in DENY.

\item Exclusively for the \DCPerm{CONFIG} access,
    no ALLOW means allow no one.
    Note that this is different than the other ALLOW configurations.
    It is different to enable more stringent security where
    older configurations are used, since
    older configuration files would not have a 
    \DCPerm{CONFIG} configuration entry.
\end{itemize}

Multiple machine entries
in the configuration files
may be separated by either a space or a comma.
The machines may be listed by

\begin{itemize}
\item Individual host names - for example: condor.cs.wisc.edu
\item Individual IP address - for example: 128.105.67.29
\item IP subnets (use a trailing ``*'') - for example: 144.105.*, 128.105.67.*
\item Host names with a wild card ``*'' character (only one ``*'' is
    allowed per name) - for example: *.cs.wisc.edu, sol*.cs.wisc.edu
\end{itemize}

To resolve an entry that falls into both allow and deny:
individual
machines have a higher order of precedence than wild card entries, and
host names with a wild card have a higher order of precedence than IP
subnets.
Otherwise, DENY has a higher order of precedence than ALLOW.
(this is how most people would intuitively expect it to work).  

In addition, the above access levels may be specified on a
per-daemon basis, instead of machine-wide for all daemons.
Do this with the subsystem string (described in
section~\ref{sec:Condor-Subsystem-Names} on Subsystem Names),
which is one of: STARTD, SCHEDD, MASTER, NEGOTIATOR,
or COLLECTOR.
For example, to grant different read access for the \Condor{schedd}:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
HOSTALLOW_READ_SCHEDD = <list of machines>
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The following is a list of registered commands that daemons will
accept.  The list is ordered by daemon.
For each daemon, the commands are grouped by the access level
required for a daemon to accept the command from a
given machine.

ALL DAEMONS:

\begin{description}
\item[\DCPerm{WRITE}]

  The command sent as a result of \Condor{reconfig} to reconfigure a daemon.

\item[\DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR}]

  The command sent as a result of \Code{reconfig -full}
  to perform a full reconfiguration on a daemon. 
\end{description}

STARTD:

\begin{description}
\item[\DCPerm{WRITE}] 

All commands that relate to a \Condor{schedd} daemon claiming
  a machine, starting jobs there, or stopping those jobs.

The command that \Condor{checkpoint} sends to periodically checkpoint
  all running jobs.

\item[\DCPerm{READ}]

The command that \Condor{preen} sends to request the
  current state of the \Condor{startd} daemon.

\item[\DCPerm{OWNER}]
The command that \Condor{vacate} sends to cause
  any running jobs to stop running.

\item[\DCPerm{NEGOTIATOR}]
The command that the \Condor{negotiator} daemon sends to
  match a machine's \Condor{startd} daemon with a given \Condor{schedd}
  daemon.
\end{description}

NEGOTIATOR:

\begin{description}
\item[\DCPerm{WRITE}]
The command that initiates a new negotiation
  cycle. It is sent by the \Condor{schedd} when new jobs are submitted
  or a \Condor{reschedule} command is issued.

\item[\DCPerm{READ}]
The command that can retrieve the current state
  of user priorities in the pool (sent by the \Condor{userprio} command).

\item[\DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR}]
The command that can set the current
  values of user priorities (sent as a result of the \Code{userprio -set}
  command).
\end{description}

COLLECTOR:

\begin{description}
\item[\DCPerm{WRITE}]
All commands that update the \Condor{collector} daemon with new ClassAds.

\item[\DCPerm{READ}]
All commands that query the \Condor{collector} daemon for ClassAds.
\end{description}

SCHEDD: 

\begin{description}
\item[\DCPerm{NEGOTIATOR}]
The command that the \Condor{negotiator} sends to
  begin negotiating with this \Condor{schedd} to match its jobs with available
  \Condor{startds}.

\item[\DCPerm{WRITE}]
The command which \Condor{reschedule} sends to
  the \Condor{schedd} to get it to update the \Condor{collector} with a current ClassAd
  and begin a negotiation cycle.

  The commands that a \Condor{startd} sends to the \Condor{schedd} when it must vacate
  its jobs and release the \Condor{schedd's} claim.

  The commands which write information into the job queue (such as
  \Condor{submit} and \Condor{hold}).  
  Note that for most commands which attempt to write to the job queue, Condor
  will perform an additional user-level authentication step.  
  This additional user-level authentication prevents, for example, an
  ordinary user from removing a different user's jobs.

\item[\DCPerm{READ}]
The command from any
  tool to view the status of the job queue.  
\end{description}

MASTER:  All commands are registered with \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR}
access:

\begin{description}
\item[restart] : Master restarts itself (and all its children)	
\item[off] : Master shuts down all its children
\item[off -master] : Master shuts down all its children and exits
\item[on] : Master spawns all the daemons it is configured to spawn
\end{description}


This section provides examples of configuration settings.
Notice that \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR} access is
only granted through a HOSTALLOW setting to explicitly grant access to
a small number of machines.  We recommend this.

\begin{itemize}

\item Let any machine join your pool.
Only the central manager has
administrative access (this is the default that ships with Condor)
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR = $(CONDOR_HOST)
HOSTALLOW_OWNER = $(FULL_HOSTNAME), $(HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\item Only allow machines at NCSA to join or view the pool.
The central manager is the only machine with \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR} access.
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
HOSTALLOW_READ = *.ncsa.uiuc.edu
HOSTALLOW_WRITE = *.ncsa.uiuc.edu
HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR = $(CONDOR_HOST)
HOSTALLOW_OWNER = $(FULL_HOSTNAME), $(HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\item Only allow machines at NCSA and the U of I Math department join the
pool, EXCEPT do \textbf{not} allow lab machines to do so.
Also, do not
allow the 177.55 subnet (perhaps this is the dial-in subnet).
Allow anyone to view pool statistics.  The machine named
bigcheese administers the pool (not the central manager).
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
HOSTALLOW_WRITE = *.ncsa.uiuc.edu, *.math.uiuc.edu
HOSTDENY_WRITE = lab-*.edu, *.lab.uiuc.edu, 177.55.*
HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR = bigcheese.ncsa.uiuc.edu
HOSTALLOW_OWNER = $(FULL_HOSTNAME), $(HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\item Only allow machines at NCSA and UW-Madison's CS department to
view the pool.  Only NCSA machines and the machine raven.cs.wisc.edu can join
the pool.
(Note: the machine raven has the read access it needs through the
wild card setting in \Macro{HOSTALLOW\_READ}).
This example also shows
how to use ``\verb@\@'' to continue a long list of machines
onto multiple lines, making it more readable (this works for all
configuration file entries, not just host access entries)
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
HOSTALLOW_READ = *.ncsa.uiuc.edu, *.cs.wisc.edu
HOSTALLOW_WRITE = *.ncsa.uiuc.edu, raven.cs.wisc.edu
HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR = $(CONDOR_HOST), bigcheese.ncsa.uiuc.edu, \
                          biggercheese.uiuc.edu
HOSTALLOW_OWNER = $(FULL_HOSTNAME), $(HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\item Allow anyone except the military to view the status of the
pool, but only let machines at NCSA view the job queues.
Only NCSA machines can join the pool.
The central manager, bigcheese, and
biggercheese can perform most administrative functions.
However, only biggercheese can update user priorities.
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
HOSTDENY_READ = *.mil
HOSTALLOW_READ_SCHEDD = *.ncsa.uiuc.edu 
HOSTALLOW_WRITE = *.ncsa.uiuc.edu
HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR = $(CONDOR_HOST), bigcheese.ncsa.uiuc.edu, \
                          biggercheese.uiuc.edu
HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR_NEGOTIATOR = biggercheese.uiuc.edu
HOSTALLOW_OWNER = $(FULL_HOSTNAME), $(HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\end{itemize}

A new security feature introduced in
Condor version 6.3.2 enables more fine-grained control over the
configuration settings that can be modified remotely with the
\Condor{config\_val} command.
The manual page for \Condor{config\_val} on
page~\pageref{man-condor-config-val} details how to use 
\Condor{config\_val} to modify configuration settings remotely. 
Since certain configuration attributes can have a large impact on the 
functioning of the Condor system and the security of the machines in a
Condor pool, it is important to restrict the ability to change
attributes remotely.

For each security access level described,
the Condor
administrator can define which configuration settings a host at that
access level is allowed to change.
Optionally, the administrator can define separate lists of settable
attributes for each Condor daemon, or the administrator
can define one list that is used by all daemons.

For each command that requests a change in configuration setting,
Condor searches all the different possible security access
levels to see which, if any, the request satisfies.
(Some hosts can qualify for multiple access levels. For example, any
host with \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR} permission probably has
\DCPerm{WRITE} permission also).
Within the qualified access level,
Condor searches for the list of attributes that may be modified.
If the request is covered by the list,
the request will be granted.
If not covered, the request will be refused.

The default configuration shipped with Condor is exceedingly
restrictive.
Condor users or administrators cannot set
configuration values from remote hosts with \Condor{config\_val}.
Enabling this feature requires a change to the
settings in the configuration file.
Use this security feature carefully.
Grant access only for attributes which you need to be able to modify
in this manner, and grant access only at the most restrictive
security level possible.

The most secure use of this feature allows Condor users to set
attributes in the configuration file which are not used by Condor
directly.
These are custom attributes published by various Condor
daemons with the \Macro{SUBSYS\_ATTRS} setting described in
section~\ref{param:SubsysAttrs} on page~\pageref{param:SubsysAttrs}.
It is secure to grant access only to modify attributes that are used by Condor
to publish information.
Granting access to modify
settings used to control the behavior of Condor is
not secure.
The goal is to
ensure no
one can use the power to change configuration attributes to compromise 
the security of your Condor pool.

The control lists are defined by configuration settings that contain 
\Macro{SETTABLE\_ATTRS} in their name.
The name of the control lists have the following form: 

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
SUBSYS_SETTABLE_ATTRS_PERMISSION-LEVEL
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The two parts of this name that can vary are
PERMISSION-LEVEL and the SUBSYS.
The PERMISSION-LEVEL can be any of the security access levels
described earlier in this section.
Examples include \DCPerm{WRITE}, \DCPerm{OWNER}, and \DCPerm{CONFIG}.

The SUBSYS is an optional portion of the name. 
It can be used to
define separate rules for which configuration attributes can be set
for each kind of Condor daemon (for example, STARTD, SCHEDD, MASTER).
There are many configuration settings that can be defined differently
for each daemon that use this SUBSYS naming convention.
See section~\ref{sec:Condor-Subsystem-Names} on
page~\pageref{sec:Condor-Subsystem-Names} for a list.
If there is no daemon-specific value for a given daemon, Condor will
look for \Macro{SETTABLE\_ATTRS\_PERMISSION-LEVEL}.

Each control list is defined by a comma-separated list of attribute
names which should be allowed to be modified.
The lists can contain wild cards characters (`*'). 

Some examples of valid definitions of control lists with explanations:

\begin{itemize}

\item \begin{verbatim}SETTABLE_ATTRS_CONFIG = *\end{verbatim}
Grant unlimited access to modify configuration attributes
to any request that came from a machine in the \DCPerm{CONFIG} access
level. 
This was the default behavior before Condor version 6.3.2.

\item \begin{verbatim}SETTABLE_ATTRS_ADMINISTRATOR = *_DEBUG, MAX_*_LOG\end{verbatim} 
Grant access to change any configuration setting that ended
with ``\_DEBUG'' (for example, \Macro{STARTD\_DEBUG}) and any
attribute that matched ``MAX\_*\_LOG'' (for example,
\Macro{MAX\_SCHEDD\_LOG}) to any host with \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR}
access. 

\item \begin{verbatim}STARTD_SETTABLE_ATTRS_OWNER = HasDataSet\end{verbatim}
Allows any request to modify the \MacroNI{HasDataSet} 
attribute that came from a host with \DCPerm{OWNER} access.
By default, \DCPerm{OWNER} covers any request originating from the
local host, plus any machines listed in the \DCPerm{ADMINISTRATOR}
level.
Therefore, any Condor job would qualify for OWNER access to the
machine where it is running. 
So, this setting would allow any process running on a given host,
including a Condor job, to modify the \MacroNI{HasDataSet} variable for
that host. 
\MacroNI{HasDataSet} is not used by Condor, it is an invented attribute
included in the \Macro{STARTD\_ATTRS} setting in order for this
example to make sense.

Condor w/ Firewalls, Private Networks, and NATs}

\index{port usage}

The \Condor{collector} and \Condor{negotiator} daemons
use well-known port numbers by default.
The \Condor{collector} uses port 9618
and the \Condor{negotiator} uses port 9614.
All other Condor daemons use dynamically chosen ports.
Other port numbers may be chosen by modifications to
the configuration.

All of these ports must be greater than 0 and less than 65,536.
They ought to be greater than 1024 in order to avoid port restrictions
on your machine, in the case that these daemons are not run as root.
Also, they need to be ports that are not in use,
or the daemons will get very unhappy and pout.

Many more details on port usage are located in
section~\ref{sec:Port-Details}.

% NAT -- Network address translation
% when access to internet uses a single IP addr/port,
%  but there are multiple computers communicating by this single
%  place
% The NAT is an extra layer that translates the multiple addr/port
%  to the single, and visa versa (from the single to one of the
%  multiple).

% Lore from Derek:
% however, "nat" is also one of those strange condor-team terms (like
% "frank") that has it's own, special meaning. :)
%
% a "nat" is a unit for measuring productivity (or lack thereof) in
% condor work over time.  it can be normalized to any time unit you
% want, by dividing the amount of work accomplished into the time scale
% you want.  1 nat is *very* little work over a given time period,
% almost too small to measure unless you use a long time scale.  at the
% time it first came up, we decided that jim basney *sleeps* at about 40
% nats, just for comparison. :)
