\index{resource limits}
\index{limits!on resource usage}

An administrator can strictly limit the usage of system resources
by jobs for any job that may be wrapped using
the script defined by the configuration variable
\Macro{USER\_JOB\_WRAPPER}.
These are jobs within universes that are controlled by the
\Condor{starter} daemon, and they include 
the \SubmitCmdNI{vanilla}, \SubmitCmdNI{standard}, \SubmitCmdNI{java},
\SubmitCmdNI{local}, and \SubmitCmdNI{parallel} universes.

The job's ClassAd is written by the \Condor{starter} daemon.
It will need to contain attributes that the script defined by
\MacroNI{USER\_JOB\_WRAPPER} can use to implement 
platform specific resource limiting actions.
Examples of resources that may be referred to for limiting purposes
are RAM, swap space, file descriptors, stack size, and core file size. 

An initial sample of a \MacroNI{USER\_JOB\_WRAPPER} script is provided
in the installation at
\File{\$(LIBEXEC)/condor\_limits\_wrapper.sh}.
Here is the contents of that file:

If used in an unmodified form,
this script sets the job's limits on a per slot basis for
memory and disk usage,
with the limits defined by the values in the machine ClassAd.
This example file will need to be modified and merged for use with a
preexisting \MacroNI{USER\_JOB\_WRAPPER} script.

If additional functionality is added to the script,
an administrator is likely to use the \MacroNI{USER\_JOB\_WRAPPER} script
in conjunction with \Macro{SUBMIT\_EXPRS} to force the job ClassAd
to contain attributes that the \MacroNI{USER\_JOB\_WRAPPER} script
expects to have defined.

The following variables are set in the environment of the
the \MacroNI{USER\_JOB\_WRAPPER} script by the \Condor{starter}
daemon, when the \MacroNI{USER\_JOB\_WRAPPER} is defined.
\begin{description}
\item[\Env{\_CONDOR\_MACHINE\_AD}
\index{environment variables!\_CONDOR\_MACHINE\_AD}]
  The full path and file name of the file containing the machine ClassAd.
\item[\Env{\_CONDOR\_JOB\_AD}
\index{environment variables!\_CONDOR\_JOB\_AD}]
  The full path and file name of the file containing the job ClassAd.
\item[\Env{\_CONDOR\_WRAPPER\_ERROR\_FILE}
\index{environment variables!\_CONDOR\_WRAPPER\_ERROR\_FILE}]
  The full path and file name of the file that the \MacroNI{USER\_JOB\_WRAPPER}
  script should create, if there is an error.
  The text in this file will be included in any HTCondor failure messages. 
\end{description}
