This section on
network communication in HTCondor
discusses which network ports are used,
how HTCondor behaves on machines with multiple network interfaces
and IP addresses,
and how to facilitate functionality in a pool that spans
firewalls and private networks.

The security section of the manual contains some
information that is relevant to the discussion of network
communication which will not be duplicated here, so please
see section~\ref{sec:Security} as well.

Firewalls, private networks, and network address translation (NAT)
pose special problems for HTCondor.
There are currently two main mechanisms for dealing with firewalls
within HTCondor:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Restrict HTCondor to use a specific range of port numbers, and
  allow connections through the firewall that use any port within the
  range.

\item Use \Term{HTCondor Connection Brokering} (CCB).

\end{enumerate}

Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages,
as described below.

% NAT -- Network address translation
% when access to internet uses a single IP addr/port,
%  but there are multiple computers communicating by this single
%  place
% The NAT is an extra layer that translates the multiple addr/port
%  to the single, and visa versa (from the single to one of the
%  multiple).

% Lore from Derek:
% however, "nat" is also one of those strange condor-team terms (like
% "frank") that has it's own, special meaning. :)
%
% a "nat" is a unit for measuring productivity (or lack thereof) in
% condor work over time.  it can be normalized to any time unit you
% want, by dividing the amount of work accomplished into the time scale
% you want.  1 nat is *very* little work over a given time period,
% almost too small to measure unless you use a long time scale.  at the
% time it first came up, we decided that jim basney *sleeps* at about 40
% nats, just for comparison. :)
