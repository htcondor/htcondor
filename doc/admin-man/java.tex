\index{Java}

Compiled Java programs may be executed (under HTCondor) on
any
execution site with a
\index{Java Virtual Machine}
\index{JVM}
Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
To do this,
HTCondor must be informed of some details of the
JVM installation.

Begin by installing a Java distribution according to the vendor's
instructions.
We have successfully used the Sun Java Developer's Kit,
but any distribution should suffice.
Your machine may have
been delivered with a JVM already installed -- installed code
is frequently found in \File{/usr/bin/java}.

HTCondor's configuration includes the location of the installed
JVM.
Edit the configuration file.
Modify the \Macro{JAVA} entry to point to the JVM binary,
typically \File{/usr/bin/java}.
Restart the \Condor{startd} daemon on that host.  For example,

\begin{verbatim}
% condor_restart -startd bluejay
\end{verbatim}

The \Condor{startd} daemon takes a few moments to exercise the Java
capabilities of the \Condor{starter}, query its properties,
and then advertise the machine
to the pool as Java-capable.
If the set up succeeded, then \Condor{status} will
tell you the host is now Java-capable by printing the Java
vendor and the version number:

\begin{verbatim}
% condor_status -java bluejay
\end{verbatim}

After a suitable amount of time, if this command does not give any output,
then the \Condor{starter}  is having difficulty executing the JVM.
The exact cause of the problem depends on the details of the
JVM, the local installation, and a variety of other factors.
We can offer only limited advice on these matters,
but here is an approach to solving the problem.

To reproduce the test that the \Condor{starter} is attempting,
try running the Java \Condor{starter} directly.  To find
where the \Condor{starter} is installed, run this command:

\begin{verbatim}
% condor_config_val STARTER
\end{verbatim}

This command prints out the path to the \Condor{starter},
perhaps something like this:

\begin{verbatim}
/usr/condor/sbin/condor_starter
\end{verbatim}

Use this path to execute the \Condor{starter} directly
with the \Arg{-classad} argument.
This tells the starter to run its tests and display its properties.

\begin{verbatim}
/usr/condor/sbin/condor_starter -classad
\end{verbatim}

This command will display a short list of cryptic properties, such as:

\begin{verbatim}
IsDaemonCore = True
HasFileTransfer = True
HasMPI = True
CondorVersion = "$CondorVersion: 7.1.0 Mar 26 2008 BuildID: 80210 $"
\end{verbatim}

If the Java configuration is correct, there will also
be a short list of Java properties, such as:

\begin{verbatim}
JavaVendor = "Sun Microsystems Inc."
JavaVersion = "1.2.2"
JavaMFlops = 9.279696
HasJava = True
\end{verbatim}

If the Java installation is incorrect, then any error
messages from the shell or Java will be printed
on the error stream instead.

The Sun JVM sets a value of 64 Mbytes for the Java Maxheap Argument,
which HTCondor uses.
This value is often too small for the application.
The administrator can change this value through configuration by setting
a different value for \Macro{JAVA\_EXTRA\_ARGUMENTS}.

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
JAVA_EXTRA_ARGUMENTS = -Xmx1024m
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Note that if a specific job sets the value in the submit description
file, using the submit command \SubmitCmd{java\_vm\_args},
this job's value takes precedence over a configured value.
