%
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!ExpectedMachineGracefulDrainingBadput}
\item[\AdAttr{ExpectedMachineGracefulDrainingBadput}:] The
job run time in cpu-seconds that would be lost if graceful draining
were initiated at the time this ClassAd was published.  
This calculation assumes
that jobs will run for the full retirement time and then be evicted
without saving a checkpoint.
%
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!ExpectedMachineGracefulDrainingCompletion}
\item[\AdAttr{ExpectedMachineGracefulDrainingCompletion}:] The
estimated time at
which graceful draining of the machine could complete if it were
initiated at the time this ClassAd was published
and there are no active claims.  This is measured in the
number of integer seconds since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1,
1970).  This value is computed with the assumption that the machine
policy will not suspend jobs during draining while the machine is
waiting for the job to use up its retirement time.  If suspension
happens, the upper bound on how long draining could take is
unlimited.  To avoid suspension during draining, the \MacroNI{SUSPEND}
and \MacroNI{CONTINUE} expressions could be configured to pay
attention to the \AdAttr{Draining} attribute.
%
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!ExpectedMachineQuickDrainingBadput}
\item[\AdAttr{ExpectedMachineGracefulQuickBadput}:] The
job run time in cpu-seconds that would be lost if quick or fast draining

\index{ClassAd machine attribute!HasVM}
\item[\AdAttr{HasVM}:] A boolean value added to the machine ClassAd
when the configuration triggers the detection of virtual machine
software.
%
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!IsWakeAble}
\item[\AdAttr{IsWakeAble}:] A boolean value that when \Expr{True} identifies
that the machine has the capability to be woken into a 
fully powered and running state by receiving a Wake On LAN (WOL) packet.
This ability is a function of the operating system, 
the network adapter in the machine 
(notably, wireless network adapters usually do not have this function),
and BIOS settings. 
When the \Condor{startd} initializes, 
it tries to detect if the operating system and network adapter both support 
waking from hibernation by receipt of a WOL packet.
The default value is \Expr{False}.
%
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!IsWakeEnabled}
\item[\AdAttr{IsWakeEnabled}:] If the hardware and software have the capacity 
to be woken into a fully powered and running state by receiving 
a Wake On LAN (WOL) packet,
this feature can still be disabled via the BIOS or software.
If BIOS or the operating system have disabled this feature, 
the \Condor{startd} sets this boolean attribute to \Expr{False}.

in the virtual machine.
%
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!KeyboardIdle}
\item[\AdAttr{KeyboardIdle}:] The number of seconds since activity on any
keyboard or mouse associated with this machine has last been detected.
Unlike \AdAttr{ConsoleIdle}, \AdAttr{KeyboardIdle} also takes activity 
on pseudo-terminals into
account.
Pseudo-terminals have virtual keyboard activity from telnet and rlogin
sessions.  Note that \AdAttr{KeyboardIdle} will always be equal to or
less than \AdAttr{ConsoleIdle}.
The value can be modified with \Macro{SLOTS\_CONNECTED\_TO\_KEYBOARD}
as defined at ~\ref{param:SlotsConnectedToKeyboard}.
%
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!KFlops}
\item[\AdAttr{KFlops}:] Relative floating point performance as determined via a
Linpack benchmark.
%
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!LastDrainStartTime}
\item[\AdAttr{LastDrainStartTime}:] Time when draining of this

\Condor{drain}).
%
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!LastHeardFrom}
\item[\AdAttr{LastHeardFrom}:] Time when the HTCondor central manager last
received a status update from this machine.  
Expressed as 
the number of integer seconds since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).
Note: This attribute is only inserted by the central manager once it
receives the ClassAd.
It is not present in the \Condor{startd} copy of the ClassAd.
Therefore, you could not use this attribute in defining \Condor{startd}
expressions (and you would not want to).
%
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!LoadAvg}
\item[\AdAttr{LoadAvg}:] A floating point number representing the 
current load average.
%
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!Machine}
\item[\AdAttr{Machine}:] A string with the machine's fully qualified host name.

\item[\AdAttr{MachineMaxVacateTime}:] An integer expression that specifies
the time in seconds the machine will allow the job to gracefully shut
down.
%
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!MaxJobRetirementTime}
\item[\AdAttr{MaxJobRetirementTime}:] When the \Condor{startd} wants
to kick the job off, a job which has run for less than this number
of seconds will not be hard-killed.  The \Condor{startd} will wait
for the job to finish or to exceed this amount of time, whichever
comes sooner.  If the job vacating policy grants the job X seconds
of vacating time, a preempted job will be soft-killed X seconds
before the end of its retirement time, so that hard-killing of the
job will not happen until the end of the retirement time if the job
does not finish shutting down before then.  This is an expression
evaluated in the context of the job ClassAd, so it may refer to job
attributes as well as machine attributes.

It is \Expr{False} otherwise.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!RemoteGroup}
\item[\AdAttr{RemoteGroup}:]  The accounting group name corresponding to
the submitter that claimed this resource.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!RemoteNegotiatingGroup}
\item[\AdAttr{RemoteNegotiatingGroup}:]  The accounting group name under
which this resource negotiated when it was claimed.  This attribute will
frequently be the same as attribute \Attr{RemoteGroup},
but it may differ in cases such
as when configuration variable \Macro{GROUP\_AUTOREGROUP} is \Expr{True},
in which case it will have the name of the root group, 
identified as \Expr{<none>}.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!RemoteOwner}
\item[\AdAttr{RemoteOwner}:] The name of the user who originally
claimed this resource.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!RemoteUser}
\item[\AdAttr{RemoteUser}:] The name of the user who is currently
using this resource.
In general, this will always be the same as the \AdAttr{RemoteOwner},
but in some cases, a resource can be claimed by one entity that hands
off the resource to another entity which uses it.
In that case, \AdAttr{RemoteUser} would hold the name of the entity
currently using the resource, while \AdAttr{RemoteOwner} would hold
the name of the entity that claimed the resource.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!PreemptingOwner}
\item[\AdAttr{PreemptingOwner}:] The name of the user who is preempting
the job that is currently running on this resource.

owner's affinity for running the HTCondor job which is waiting for the
current job to finish or be preempted.  If not currently hosting an
HTCondor job, \AdAttr{PreemptingRank} is undefined.  When a machine is
claimed and there is already a job running, the attribute's value is
computed by evaluating the machine's \AdAttr{Rank} expression with
respect to the preempting job's ClassAd.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!TotalClaimRunTime}
\item[\AdAttr{TotalClaimRunTime}:] A running total of the amount of

executing, since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).  For idle
machines, the value is \Expr{UNDEFINED}.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (when running)!LastPeriodicCheckpoint}
\item[\AdAttr{LastPeriodicCheckpoint}:] If the job has performed a
periodic checkpoint, this attribute will be defined and will hold the
time stamp of when the last periodic checkpoint was begun.
If the job has yet to perform a periodic checkpoint, or cannot
checkpoint at all, the \AdAttr{LastPeriodicCheckpoint} attribute will
not be defined.

\end{description}

\item[\AdAttr{Offline}:] A boolean value, that when \Expr{True},
indicates this machine is in an offline state in the \Condor{collector}.
Such ClassAds are stored persistently,
