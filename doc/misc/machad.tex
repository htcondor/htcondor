\index{ClassAd machine attribute!CanHibernate}
\item[\AdAttr{CanHibernate}:] The \Condor{startd} has the capability to 
shut down or hibernate a machine when certain configurable criteria are met.
However, before the \Condor{startd} can shut down a machine, 
the hardware itself must support hibernation, as must the operating system. 
When the \Condor{startd} initializes, 
it checks for this support.
If the machine has the ability to hibernate, 
then this boolean ClassAd attribute will be \Expr{True}.
By default, it is \Expr{False}.

\AdAttr{Rank} expression with respect to the current job's ClassAd.
%
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!Disk}
\item[\AdAttr{Disk}:] The amount of disk space on this machine available for
the job in Kbytes ( e.g. 23000 = 23 megabytes ).  Specifically, this

\index{ClassAd machine attribute!ExpectedMachineGracefulDrainingBadput}
\item[\AdAttr{ExpectedMachineGracefulDrainingBadput}:] The
job runtime in cpu-seconds that would be lost if graceful draining
were initiated at the time this ad was published.  This calculation assumes

%
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!ExpectedMachineGracefulDrainingCompletion}
\item[\AdAttr{ExpectedMachineGracefulDrainingCompletion}:] Time at
which graceful draining of the machine could complete if it were
initiated at the time this ad was published.  This is measured in the
number of integer seconds since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1,
1970).  This value is computed with the assumption that the machine
policy will not suspend jobs during draining while the machine is
waiting for the job to use up its retirement time.  If suspension
happens, the upper bound on how long draining could take is
unlimited.  To avoid suspension during draining, the \MacroNI{SUSPEND}
and \MacroNI{CONTINUE} expressions could be configured to pay
attention to the \AdAttr{Draining} attribute.
%
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!ExpectedMachineQuickDrainingBadput}
\item[\AdAttr{ExpectedMachineGracefulQuickBadput}:] The
job runtime in cpu-seconds that would be lost if quick draining

\item[\AdAttr{HasVM}:] A boolean value added to the machine ClassAd
when the configuration triggers the detection of virtual machine
software.
%
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!IsWakeAble}
\item[\AdAttr{IsWakeAble}:] A boolean value that when \Expr{True} identifies
that the machine has the capability to be woken into a 
fully powered and running state by receiving a Wake On LAN (WOL) packet.
This ability is a function of the operating system, 
the network adapter in the machine 
(notably, wireless network adapters usually do not have this function),
and BIOS settings. 
When the \Condor{startd} initializes, 
it tries to detect if the operating system and network adapter both support 
waking from hibernation by receipt of a WOL packet.
The default value is \Expr{False}.
%
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!IsWakeEnabled}
\item[\AdAttr{IsWakeEnabled}:] If the hardware and software have the capacity 
to be woken into a fully powered and running state by receiving 
a Wake On LAN (WOL) packet,
this feature can still be disabled via the BIOS or software.
If BIOS or the operating system have disabled this feature, 
the \Condor{startd} sets this boolean attribute to \Expr{False}.
%
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!JobVM\_VCPUS}

is running on this slot.  Defined by the number of virtualized CPUs
in the virtual machine.
%
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!KeyboardIdle}
\item[\AdAttr{KeyboardIdle}:] The number of seconds since activity on any
keyboard or mouse associated with this machine has last been detected.
Unlike \AdAttr{ConsoleIdle}, \AdAttr{KeyboardIdle} also takes activity 
on pseudo-terminals into
account (i.e. virtual ``keyboard'' activity from telnet and rlogin
sessions as well).  Note that \AdAttr{KeyboardIdle} will always be equal to or
less than \AdAttr{ConsoleIdle}.
%
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!KFlops}
\item[\AdAttr{KFlops}:] Relative floating point performance as determined via a
Linpack benchmark.
%
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!LastDrainStartTime}

received a status update from this machine.  
Expressed as 
the number of integer seconds since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).
Note: This attribute is only inserted by the central manager once it
receives the ClassAd.
It is not present in the \Condor{startd} copy of the ClassAd.
Therefore, you could not use this attribute in defining \Condor{startd}
expressions (and you would not want to).

\index{ClassAd machine attribute!Requirements}
\item[\AdAttr{Requirements}:] A boolean, which when evaluated within the context
of the machine ClassAd and a job ClassAd, must evaluate to
TRUE before HTCondor will allow the job to use this machine.

\item[\AdAttr{MaxJobRetirementTime}:] When the \Condor{startd} wants
to kick the job off, a job which has run for less than this number
of seconds will not be hard-killed.  The \Condor{startd} will wait
for the job to finish or to exceed this amount of time, whichever
comes sooner.  If the job vacating policy grants the job X seconds
of vacating time, a preempted job will be soft-killed X seconds
before the end of its retirement time, so that hard-killing of the
job will not happen until the end of the retirement time if the job
does not finish shutting down before then.  This is an expression
evaluated in the context of the job ClassAd, so it may refer to job
attributes as well as machine attributes.

after \AdAttr{MyCurrentTime} when the running job can be evicted.
\AdAttr{MaxJobRetirementTime} is the expression of how much retirement
time the machine offers to new jobs, whereas \AdAttr{RetirementTimeRemaining}
is the negotiated amount of time remaining for the current running
job.  This may be less than the amount offered by the machine's
\AdAttr{MaxJobRetirementTime} expression, because the job may
ask for less.

In addition, there are a few attributes that are automatically
inserted into the machine ClassAd whenever a resource is in the
Claimed state:

\begin{description}

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!ClientMachine}
\item[\AdAttr{ClientMachine}:] The host name of the machine that has
claimed this resource

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!RemoteAutoregroup}
\item[\AdAttr{RemoteAutoregroup}:]  A boolean attribute which is \Expr{True}
if this resource was claimed via negotiation 
when the configuration variable \Macro{GROUP\_AUTOREGROUP} is \Expr{True}.
It is \Expr{False} otherwise.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!RemoteGroup}
\item[\AdAttr{RemoteGroup}:]  The accounting group name corresponding to
the submitter that claimed this resource.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!RemoteNegotiatingGroup}
\item[\AdAttr{RemoteNegotiatingGroup}:]  The accounting group name under
which this resource negotiated when it was claimed.  This attribute will
frequently be the same as attribute \Attr{RemoteGroup},
but it may differ in cases such
as when configuration variable \Macro{GROUP\_AUTOREGROUP} is \Expr{True},
in which case it will have the name of the root group, 
identified as \Expr{<none>}.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!RemoteOwner}
\item[\AdAttr{RemoteOwner}:] The name of the user who originally
claimed this resource.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!RemoteUser}
\item[\AdAttr{RemoteUser}:] The name of the user who is currently
using this resource.
In general, this will always be the same as the \AdAttr{RemoteOwner},
but in some cases, a resource can be claimed by one entity that hands
off the resource to another entity which uses it.
In that case, \AdAttr{RemoteUser} would hold the name of the entity
currently using the resource, while \AdAttr{RemoteOwner} would hold
the name of the entity that claimed the resource.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!PreemptingOwner}
\item[\AdAttr{PreemptingOwner}:] The name of the user who is preempting
the job that is currently running on this resource.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!PreemptingUser}
\item[\AdAttr{PreemptingUser}:] The name of the user who is preempting
the job that is currently running on this resource.  The relationship
between \AdAttr{PreemptingUser} and \AdAttr{PreemptingOwner} is the same
as the relationship between \AdAttr{RemoteUser} and \AdAttr{RemoteOwner}.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!PreemptingRank}
\item[\AdAttr{PreemptingRank}:] A float which represents this machine
owner's affinity for running the HTCondor job which is waiting for the
current job to finish or be preempted.  If not currently hosting an
HTCondor job, \AdAttr{PreemptingRank} is undefined.  When a machine is
claimed and there is already a job running, the attribute's value is
computed by evaluating the machine's \AdAttr{Rank} expression with
respect to the preempting job's ClassAd.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!TotalClaimRunTime}
\item[\AdAttr{TotalClaimRunTime}:] A running total of the amount of
time (in seconds) that all jobs (under the same claim) ran
(have spent in the Claimed/Busy state).


\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!TotalClaimSuspendTime}
\item[\AdAttr{TotalClaimSuspendTime}:] A running total of the amount of
time (in seconds) that all jobs (under the same claim) have been
suspended (in the Claimed/Suspended state).

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!TotalJobRunTime}
\item[\AdAttr{TotalJobRunTime}:] A running total of the amount of
time (in seconds) that a single job ran
(has spent in the Claimed/Busy state).

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!TotalJobSuspendTime}
\item[\AdAttr{TotalJobSuspendTime}:] A running total of the amount of
time (in seconds) that a single job has been suspended
(in the Claimed/Suspended state).

\end{description}

There are a few attributes that are only inserted into the
machine ClassAd if a job is currently executing.  
If the resource is claimed but no job are running, none of these
attributes will be defined.

\begin{description}

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (when running)!JobId}
\item[\AdAttr{JobId}:] The job's identifier (for example,
\verb@152.3@), as seen from \Condor{q}
on the submitting machine.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (when running)!JobStart}
\item[\AdAttr{JobStart}:] The time stamp in integer seconds of when the job began
executing, since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).  For idle
machines, the value is \Expr{UNDEFINED}.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (when running)!LastPeriodicCheckpoint}
\item[\AdAttr{LastPeriodicCheckpoint}:] If the job has performed a
periodic checkpoint, this attribute will be defined and will hold the
time stamp of when the last periodic checkpoint was begun.
If the job has yet to perform a periodic checkpoint, or cannot
checkpoint at all, the \AdAttr{LastPeriodicCheckpoint} attribute will
not be defined.

\end{description}

\index{offline ClassAd}
There are a few attributes that are applicable to machines that
are offline, that is, hibernating.

\begin{description}

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (when offline)!MachineLastMatchTime}
\item[\AdAttr{MachineLastMatchTime}:] The Unix epoch time when this offline 
ClassAd
would have been matched to a job, if the machine were online.  
In addition,
the slot1 ClassAd of a multi-slot machine will have 
\AdAttr{slot<X>\_MachineLastMatchTime} defined,
where \Expr{<X>} is replaced by the slot id of each of the slots
with \AdAttr{MachineLastMatchTime} defined.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (when offline)!Offline}
\item[\AdAttr{Offline}:] A boolean value, that when \Expr{True},
indicates this machine is in an offline state in the \Condor{collector}.
Such ClassAds are stored persistently, 
such that they will continue to exist after the \Condor{collector} restarts.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (when offline)!Unhibernate}
\item[\AdAttr{Unhibernate}:] A boolean expression that specifies when
a hibernating machine should be woken up, for example, by \Condor{rooster}.

\end{description}

Finally, the single attribute, 
\Attr{CurrentTime}, is defined by the ClassAd
environment.
\begin{description}
\index{ClassAd attribute!CurrentTime}
\item[\AdAttr{CurrentTime}:] Evaluates to the 
the number of integer seconds since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).
\end{description}
