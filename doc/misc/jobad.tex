An integer that specifies the maximum number of seconds for which
delegated proxies should be valid.  The default behavior is determined
by the configuration
setting \Macro{DELEGATE\_JOB\_GSI\_CREDENTIALS\_LIFETIME}, which
defaults to one day.  A value of 0 indicates that the delegated proxy
should be valid for as long as allowed by the credential used to
create the proxy.  This setting currently only applies to proxies
delegated for non-grid jobs and HTCondor-C jobs.  It does not currently
apply to globus grid jobs, which always behave as though this setting
were 0.  This setting has no effect if the configuration
setting \Macro{DELEGATE\_JOB\_GSI\_CREDENTIALS} is false, because in
that case the job proxy is copied rather than delegated.

\clearpage

%%% ClassAd attribute: HoldReasonSubCode
\index{ClassAd job attribute!HoldReasonSubCode}
\index{HoldReasonSubCode!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{HoldReasonSubCode}:]    An integer value that represents further

%%% ClassAd attribute: HookKeyword
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!HookKeyword}
\item[\AdAttr{HookKeyword}:] A string that uniquely identifies
a set of job hooks, and added to the ClassAd once a job is fetched.

%%% ClassAd attribute: ImageSize
\index{ClassAd job attribute!ImageSize}
\index{ImageSize!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{ImageSize}:]  Maximum observed memory image size
(i.e. virtual memory) of the
job in Kbytes.  The initial value is equal to the size of the
executable for non-vm universe jobs, and 0 for vm universe jobs.
When the job writes a checkpoint, the \AdAttr{ImageSize}
attribute is set to the size of the checkpoint file (since the
checkpoint file contains the job's memory image).
A vanilla universe job's \AdAttr{ImageSize} is recomputed
internally every 15 seconds.
How quickly this updated information becomes visible to \Condor{q} is
controlled by \MacroNI{SHADOW\_QUEUE\_UPDATE\_INTERVAL} and
\MacroNI{STARTER\_UPDATE\_INTERVAL}.

Under Linux, \AdAttr{ProportionalSetSize} is a better indicator of
memory usage for jobs with significant sharing of memory between
processes, because \AdAttr{ImageSize} is simply the sum of virtual
memory sizes across all of the processes in the job, which may count
the same memory pages more than once.

page~\pageref{param:EventLogJobAdInformationAttrs}) but it applies to
the job event log instead of the system event log.

%%% ClassAd attribute: JobDescription
\index{ClassAd job attribute!JobDescription}
\index{JobDescription!job ClassAd attribute}
\label{JobDescription-job-attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{JobDescription}:]  A string that may be defined for
a job by setting \SubmitCmd{description} in the submit description file.

of seconds that the \Condor{schedd} will continue to keep a claim,
in the Claimed Idle state,
after the job with this attribute defined completes, 
and there are no other jobs ready to run from this user.
This attribute may improve the performance of linear DAGs,
in the case when a dependent job can not be scheduled until its
parent has completed.
Extending the claim on the machine may permit the dependent job to be
scheduled with less delay than with waiting for the \Condor{negotiator}
to match with a new machine.

\index{MaxTransferInputMB!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{MaxTransferInputMB}:]
This integer expression specifies the maximum allowed total size in
Mbytes of the input files that are transferred for a job.  This
expression does \emph{not} apply to grid universe, standard universe, or
files transferred via file transfer plug-ins.  The expression may refer
to attributes of the job.  The special value -1 indicates no limit.
If not set, the system setting \Macro{MAX\_TRANSFER\_INPUT\_MB} is
used.  If the observed size of all input files at submit time is
larger than the limit, the job will be immediately placed on hold with
a \Attr{HoldReasonCode} value of 32.
If the job passes this initial test, but the size of
the input files increases or the limit decreases so that the limit is
violated, the job will be placed on hold at the time when the file
transfer is attempted.

\index{Nonessential!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{Nonessential}:]  A boolean value only relevant to grid universe
jobs, which when \Expr{True} tells HTCondor to simply abort (remove) 
any problematic job, instead of putting the job on hold.
It is the equivalent of doing \Condor{rm} followed by 
\Condor{rm} \Opt{-forcex} any time the job would have otherwise gone on hold. 
If not explicitly set to \Expr{True}, the default value will be \Expr{False}.

%%% ClassAd attribute: NTDomain
\index{ClassAd job attribute!NTDomain}
\index{NTDomain!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{NTDomain}:]  A string that identifies the NT domain under

\index{ClassAd job attribute!NumShadowStarts}
\index{NumShadowStarts!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{NumShadowStarts}:]  An integer count of the number of
  times a \Condor{shadow} daemon was started for a given job.
  This attribute is not defined for
  \SubmitCmdNI{scheduler} universe jobs, since
  they do not have a \Condor{shadow} daemon associated with them.
  For \SubmitCmdNI{local} universe jobs, this attribute \emph{is}
  defined, even though the process that manages the job is technically
  a \Condor{starter} rather than a \Condor{shadow}.  
  This keeps the management of the
  local universe and other universes as similar as possible.

%%% ClassAd attribute: NumSystemHolds
\index{ClassAd job attribute!NumSystemHolds}
\index{NumSystemHolds!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{NumSystemHolds}:]   An integer that is incremented each time
HTCondor-G places a job on hold due to some sort of error condition.  This
counter is useful, since HTCondor-G will always place a job on hold when it
gives up on some error condition.  Note that if the user places the job
on hold using the \Condor{hold} command, this attribute is not incremented.

%%% ClassAd attribute: OtherJobRemoveRequirements
\label{attribute-OtherJobRemoveRequirements}
\index{ClassAd job attribute!OtherJobRemoveRequirements}
\index{OtherJobRemoveRequirements!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{OtherJobRemoveRequirements}:]
A string that defines a list of jobs.
When the job with this attribute defined is removed,
all other jobs defined by the list are also removed.
The string is an expression that defines a constraint equivalent to
the one implied by the command 
\begin{verbatim}
  condor_rm -constraint <constraint>
\end{verbatim}
This attribute is used for jobs managed with \Condor{dagman} to ensure
that node jobs of the DAG are removed when the \Condor{dagman} job
itself is removed.  Note that the list of jobs defined by this attribute
must not form a cyclic removal of jobs,
or the \Condor{schedd} will go into an infinite loop 
when any of the jobs is removed.

%%% ClassAd attribute: Owner
\index{ClassAd job attribute!Owner}
\index{Owner!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{Owner}:]  String describing the user who submitted this
job.

\index{ClassAd job attribute!ParallelShutdownPolicy}
\index{ParallelShutdownPolicy!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{ParallelShutdownPolicy}:]  A string that is only relevant
to parallel universe jobs.  Without this attribute defined, the default
policy applied to parallel universe jobs is to consider the whole job
completed when the first node exits, killing processes running on
all remaining nodes.  If defined to the following strings, HTCondor's
behavior changes:
  \begin{description}
  \item[\AdStr{WAIT\_FOR\_ALL}] HTCondor will wait until every node in 
  the parallel job has completed to consider the job finished.
  \end{description}

%%% ClassAd attribute: PreserveRelativeExecutable

\index{PreserveRelativeExecutable!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{PreserveRelativeExecutable}:]  When \Expr{True}, 
the \Condor{starter} will not prepend \Attr{Iwd}
to \Attr{Cmd}, when \Attr{Cmd} is a relative path name
and \Attr{TransferExecutable} is \Expr{False}.  
The default value is \Expr{False}.
This attribute is primarily of interest for users of 
\MacroNI{USER\_JOB\_WRAPPER}
for the purpose of allowing an executable's location to be resolved 
by the user's path in the job wrapper.

%%% ClassAd attribute: ProcId
\index{ClassAd job attribute!ProcId}
\index{ProcId!job ClassAd attribute}
\index{process!definition for a submitted job}
\index{job ID!process identifier}
\item[\AdAttr{ProcId}:]  Integer process identifier for this job.
Within a cluster of many jobs,
each job has the same \Attr{ClusterId}, but will have a unique \Attr{ProcId}.
Within a cluster, assignment of a \Attr{ProcId} value will start
with the value 0.
The job (process) identifier described here is unrelated to operating
system PIDs.

%%% ClassAd attribute: ProportionalSetSizeKb

support monitoring of PSS or PSS has not yet been measured,
this attribute will be undefined.  
PSS differs from \AdAttr{ImageSize} in how memory shared
between processes is accounted.
The PSS for one process is the sum of that process' memory pages 
divided by the number of processes sharing each of the pages.
\Attr{ImageSize} is the same,
except there is no division by the number of processes sharing the pages.
