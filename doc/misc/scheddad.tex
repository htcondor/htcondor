\label{sec:FT-Scheduler-ClassAd-Attributes}
When using file transfer concurrency limits, 
the following additional I/O usage statistics are published.
These includes the sum and rate of bytes
transferred as well as time spent reading and writing to files and
to the network.  These statistics are reported for the sum of all
users and may also be reported individually for recently active users
by increasing the verbosity level \Expr{STATISTICS\_TO\_PUBLISH = TRANSFER:2}.
Each of the per-user statistics is prefixed by a
user name in the form \AdAttr{Owner\_<username>\_FileTransferUploadBytes}.
In this case, the attribute represents activity by the specified user.
The published user name is actually the file transfer queue name, 
as defined by configuration variable \Macro{TRANSFER\_QUEUE\_USER\_EXPR}.
This expression defaults to \AdAttr{Owner\_} followed by the name of the job
owner.
The attributes that are rates have a
suffix that specifies the time span of the exponential moving average.
By default the time spans that are published are 1m, 5m, 1h, and 1d.
This can be changed by configuring configuration variable
\Macro{TRANSFER\_IO\_REPORT\_TIMESPANS}.  These attributes are only
reported once a full time span has accumulated.

\begin{description}

\index{ClassAd Scheduler attribute!FileTransferDiskThrottleExcess}
\item[\AdAttr{FileTransferDiskThrottleExcess\_<timespan>}]
  The exponential moving average of the disk load that exceeds the
  upper limit set for the disk load throttle.  Periods of time in
  which there is no excess and no waiting transfers do not contribute
  to the average.
  This attribute is published only if configuration variable 
  \MacroNI{FILE\_TRANSFER\_DISK\_LOAD\_THROTTLE} is defined.

\index{ClassAd Scheduler attribute!FileTransferDiskThrottleHigh}
\item[\AdAttr{FileTransferDiskThrottleHigh}]
  The desired upper limit for the disk load from file transfers, as configured
  by \Macro{FILE\_TRANSFER\_DISK\_LOAD\_THROTTLE}.
  This attribute is published only if configuration variable 
  \MacroNI{FILE\_TRANSFER\_DISK\_LOAD\_THROTTLE} is defined.

\index{ClassAd Scheduler attribute!FileTransferDiskThrottleLevel}
\item[\AdAttr{FileTransferDiskThrottleLevel}]

\index{ClassAd Scheduler attribute!FileTransferDiskThrottleLow}
\item[\AdAttr{FileTransferDiskThrottleLow}]

\index{ClassAd Scheduler attribute!FileTransferDiskThrottleShortfall}
\item[\AdAttr{FileTransferDiskThrottleShortfall\_<timespan>}]

  upper limit set for the disk load throttle.  Periods of time in
  which there is no excess and no waiting transfers do not contribute
  to the average.
  This attribute is published only if configuration variable 
  \MacroNI{FILE\_TRANSFER\_DISK\_LOAD\_THROTTLE} is defined.

\index{ClassAd Scheduler attribute!FileTransferDownloadBytes}
\item[\AdAttr{FileTransferDownloadBytes}] Total number of bytes
  downloaded as output from jobs since this \Condor{schedd} was
  started.
  If \Macro{STATISTICS\_TO\_PUBLISH} contains \Expr{TRANSFER:2},
  for each active user, this attribute is also published prefixed by
  the user name, with the name \AdAttr{Owner\_<username>\_FileTransferDownloadBytes}.

  \Macro{TRANSFER\_IO\_REPORT\_TIMESPANS}, which defaults to
  1m, 5m, 1h, and 1d.  When less than one full time span has
  accumulated, the attribute is not published.
  If \Macro{STATISTICS\_TO\_PUBLISH} contains \Expr{TRANSFER:2},
  for each active user, this attribute is also published prefixed by
  the user name, with the name 
  \AdAttr{Owner\_<username>\_FileTransferDownloadBytesPerSecond\_<timespan>}.
  The published user name is actually the file transfer queue name, as
  defined by configuration variable \Macro{TRANSFER\_QUEUE\_USER\_EXPR}.

\index{ClassAd Scheduler attribute!FileTransferFileReadLoad}
\item[\AdAttr{FileTransferFileReadLoad\_<timespan>}] Exponential
  moving average over the specified time span of the rate at which
  submit-side file transfer processes have spent time reading from
  files to be transferred as input to jobs.  One file transfer process
  spending nearly all of its time reading files will generate a load
  close to 1.0.
  The time spans that are published are configured by
  \Macro{TRANSFER\_IO\_REPORT\_TIMESPANS}, which defaults to
  1m, 5m, 1h, and 1d.  When less than one full time span has
  accumulated, the attribute is not published.
  If \Macro{STATISTICS\_TO\_PUBLISH} contains \Expr{TRANSFER:2},
  for each active user, this attribute is also published prefixed by

  transferred as input to jobs since this \Condor{schedd} was started.
  If \Macro{STATISTICS\_TO\_PUBLISH} contains \Expr{TRANSFER:2},
  for each active user, this attribute is also published prefixed by
  the user name, with the name
  \AdAttr{Owner\_<username>\_FileTransferFileReadSeconds}.
  The published user name is actually the file transfer queue name, as
  defined by configuration variable \Macro{TRANSFER\_QUEUE\_USER\_EXPR}.

\index{ClassAd Scheduler attribute!FileTransferFileWriteLoad}
\item[\AdAttr{FileTransferFileWriteLoad\_<timespan>}]
  Exponential moving average over the specified time span of the rate
  at which submit-side file transfer processes have spent time writing to files
  transferred as output from jobs.  One file transfer process spending
  nearly all of its time writing to files will generate a load close

  The time spans that are published are configured by
  \Macro{TRANSFER\_IO\_REPORT\_TIMESPANS}, which defaults to
  1m, 5m, 1h, and 1d.  When less than one full time span has
  accumulated, the attribute is not published.

  average over the specified time span of the rate at which submit-side
  file transfer processes have spent time reading from the network
  when transferring output from jobs.  One file transfer process
  spending nearly all of its time reading from the network will
  generate a load close to 1.0.  The reason a file transfer process may
  spend a long time writing to the network could be a network
  bottleneck on the path between the submit and execute machine.  It
  could also be caused by slow reads from the disk on the execute side.
  The time spans that are published are configured by
  \Macro{TRANSFER\_IO\_REPORT\_TIMESPANS}, which defaults to
  1m, 5m, 1h, and 1d.  When less than one full time span has
