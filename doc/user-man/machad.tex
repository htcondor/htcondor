\item[Activity] : String which describes Condor job activity on the machine.
Can have one of the following values:
	\begin{description}
	\item[``Idle''] : There is no job activity
	\item[``Busy''] : A job is busy running
	\item[``Suspended''] : A job is currently suspended
	\item[``Vacating''] : A job is currently checkpointing
	\item[``Killing''] : A job is currently being killed
	\item[``Benchmarking''] : The startd is running benchmarks
	\end{description}
%
\item[AFSCell] : If the machine is running AFS, this is a string
containing the AFS cell name.
%
\item[Arch] : String with the architecture of the machine.  Typically
one of the following: 
	\begin{description}
	\item[``INTEL''] : Intel CPU (Pentium, Pentium II, etc).
	\item[``ALPHA''] : Digital Alpha CPU
	\item[``SGI''] : Silicon Graphics MIPS CPU
	\item[``SUN4u''] : Sun UltraSparc CPU
	\item[``SUN4x''] : A Sun Sparc CPU other than an UltraSparc, i.e.
sun4m or sun4c CPU found in older Sparc workstations such as the Sparc~10, 
Sparc~20, IPC, IPX, etc.
	\item[``HPPA1''] :  Hewlett Packard PA-RISC 1.x CPU (i.e. PA-RISC    
                      7000 series CPU) based workstation
	\item[``HPPA2''] :  Hewlett Packard PA-RISC 2.x CPU (i.e. PA-RISC    
                      8000 series CPU) based workstation
	\end{description}
%
\item[ClockDay] : The day of the week, where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, \Dots, 6 = Saturday. 
%
\item[ClockMin] : The number of minutes passed since midnight.
%
\item[CondorLoadAvg] : The load average generated by Condor (either
from remote jobs or running benchmarks).
%
\item[ConsoleIdle] : The number of seconds since activity on the system
console keyboard or console mouse has last been detected.
%
\item[Cpus] : Number of CPUs in this machine, i.e. 1 = single CPU machine, 2 = dual
CPUs, etc.
%
\item[CurrentRank] : A float which represents this machine owner's affinity
for running the Condor job which it is currently hosting.  If not
currently hosting a Condor job, CurrentRank is -1.0.
%
\item[Disk] : The amount of disk space on this machine available for
the job in kbytes ( e.g. 23000 = 23 megabytes ).  Specifically, this
is the amount of disk space available in the directory specified in
the Condor configuration files by the \Macro{EXECUTE} macro, minus any
space reserved with the \Macro{RESERVED\_DISK} macro.
%
\item[EnteredCurrentActivity] : Time at which the machine entered the 
current Activity (see \AdAttr{Activity} entry above).  Measured in the
number of seconds since the epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).
%
\item[FileSystemDomain] : a domain name configured by the Condor 
administrator which describes a cluster of machines which all access 
the same networked filesystems usually via NFS or AFS.  
%
\item[KeyboardIdle] : The number of seconds since activity on any
keyboard or mouse associated with this machine has last been detected.
Unlike \AdAttr{ConsoleIdle}, \AdAttr{KeyboardIdle} also takes activity 
on pseudo-terminals into
account (i.e. virtual ``keyboard'' activity from telnet and rlogin
sessions as well).  Note that \AdAttr{KeyboardIdle} will always be equal to or
less than \AdAttr{ConsoleIdle}.
%
\item[KFlops] : Relative floating point performance as determined via a
linpack benchmark.
%
\item[LastHeardForm] : Time when the Condor Central Manager last
received a status update from this machine.  
Expressed as seconds since the epoch (integer value).
Note: This attribute is only inserted by the Central Manager once it
receives the ClassAd.
It is not present in the startd's copy of the ClassAd.
Therefore, you couldn't use this attribute in defining startd
expressions (which you wouldn't want to, anyway).
%
\item[LoadAvg] : A floating point number with the machine's current load
average.
%
\item[Machine] : A string with the machine's fully qualified hostname.
%
\item[Memory] : The amount of RAM in megabytes.
%
\item[Mips] : Relative integer performance as determined via a dhrystone
benchmark.
%
\item[MyType] : The ClassAd type; always set to the literal string ``Machine''.
%
\item[Name] : The name of this resource; typically the same value as
the \AdAttr{Machine} attribute, but could be customized by the site
administrator.
On SMP machines, the startd will divide the CPUs up into seperate
virtual machines, each with with a unique name.
These names will be of the form ``vm\#@full.hostname'', for example,
``vm1@vulture.cs.wisc.edu'', which signifies virtual machine 1 from
vulture.cs.wisc.edu. 
%
\item[OpSys] : String describing the operating system running on this
machine.  For Condor \VersionNotice\ typically one of the following:
	\begin{description}
	\item ``HPUX10'' (for HPUX 10.20)
	\item ``IRIX6''  (for IRIX 6.2, 6.3, or 6.4)
	\item ``LINUX''  (for LINUX 2.0.x kernel systems)
	\item ``LINUX-GLIBC''  (for LINUX systems, using GNU's libc)
	\item ``OSF1''	 (for Digital Unix 4.x)
	\item ``SOLARIS251''
	\item ``SOLARIS26''
	\end{description}
%
\item[Requirements] : A boolean which, when evaluated within the context
of the Machine ClassAd and a Job ClassAd, must evaluate to
TRUE before Condor will allow the job to use this machine.
%
\item[StartdIpAddr] : String with the IP and port address of the
\Condor{startd} daemon which is publishing this Machine ClassAd.
%
\item[State] : String which publishes the machine's Condor state, which
can be:
	\begin{description}
	\item[``Owner''] : The machine owner is using the machine, and
it is unavailable to Condor.
	\item[``Unclaimed''] : The machine is available to run Condor jobs,
but a good match (i.e. job to run here) is either not available or not 
yet found.
	\item[``Matched''] : The Condor Central Manager has found a good
match for this resource, but a Condor scheduler has not yet claimed it.
	\item[``Claimed''] : The machine is claimed by a remote
\Condor{schedd} and is probably running a job.
	\item[``Preempting''] : A Condor job is being preempted (possibly
via checkpointing) in order to clear the machine for either a higher
priority job or because the machine owner wants the machine back.
	\end{description}   % of State
%
\item[TargetType] : Describes what type of ClassAd to match with.
Always set to the string literal ``Job'', because Machine ClassAds
always want to be matched with Jobs, and vice-versa.
%
\item[UidDomain] : a domain name configured by the Condor 
administrator which describes a cluster of machines which all have 
the same "passwd" file entries, and therefore all have the same logins.
%
\item[VirtualMemory] : The amount of currently available virtual memory 
(swap space) expressed in kbytes.
