%%% ClassAd attribute: CkptArch
\index{ClassAd job attribute!CkptArch}
\item[\AdAttr{CkptArch}] : String describing the architecture of the machine

\end{verbatim}
will equal the number of seconds that the job has been on hold.

%%% ClassAd attribute: ExecutableSize

%%% ClassAd attribute: ExitBySignal
\index{ClassAd job attribute!ExitBySignal}

\item[\AdAttr{ExitStatus}] : The way that Condor previously dealt with
a job's exit status.

%%% ClassAd attribute: ImageSize
\index{ClassAd job attribute!ImageSize}
\item[\AdAttr{ImageSize}] : Estimate of the memory image size of the
job in Kbytes.  The initial estimate may be specified in the job
submit file.  Otherwise, the initial value is equal to the size of the
executable.  When the job checkpoints, the \AdAttr{ImageSize}
attribute is set to the size of the checkpoint file (since the
checkpoint file contains the job's memory image).
A vanilla universe job's \AdAttr{ImageSize} is recomputed
internally every 15 seconds.

%%% ClassAd attribute: LastCkptTime
\index{ClassAd job attribute!LastCkptTime}
\item[\AdAttr{LastCkptTime}] : Time at which the job last performed a
successful checkpoint.  Measured in the number of seconds since the
epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).

%%% ClassAd attribute: LastMatchTime

%%% ClassAd attribute: LastVacateTime
\index{ClassAd job attribute!LastVacateTime}
\item[\AdAttr{LastVacateTime}] : Time at which the job was last
evicted from a remote workstation.  Measured in the number of seconds

this is a nice-user job.

time the \Condor{gridmanager} receives confirmation of a successful job
submission into Globus.

%%% ClassAd attribute: NumJobMatches
\index{ClassAd job attribute!NumJobMatches}

\index{ClassAd job attribute!NumSystemHolds}
\item[\AdAttr{NumSystemHolds}] :  An integer that is incremented each time
Condor-G places a job on hold due to some sort of error condition.  This
counter is useful, since Condor-G will always place a job on hold when it
gives up on some error condition.  Note that if the user places the job
on hold using the \Condor{hold} command, this attribute is not incremented.

%%% ClassAd attribute: Owner
\index{ClassAd job attribute!Owner}
\item[\AdAttr{Owner}] : String describing the user who submitted this
job.

%%% ClassAd attribute: ProcId
\index{ClassAd job attribute!ProcId}

\index{ClassAd job attribute!RemoteWallClockTime}
\item[\AdAttr{RemoteWallClockTime}] : Cumulative number of seconds
the job has been allocated a machine.
This also includes time spent in suspension (if any),
so the total real time spent running is 
\begin{verbatim}
RemoteWallClockTime - CumulativeSuspensionTime
\end{verbatim}
Note that this number does not get reset to
zero when a job is forced to migrate from one machine to another.

%%% ClassAd attribute: RemoveKillSig
\index{ClassAd job attribute!RemoveKillSig}
\item[\AdAttr{RemoveKillSig}] :   Currently only for scheduler universe jobs,
a string containing a name of

standard error is streamed back to the submit machine, instead
of doing the transfer (as a whole) after the job completes.
If \Arg{False}, then
standard error is transfered back to the submit machine
