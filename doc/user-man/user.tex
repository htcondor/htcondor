Presenting HTCondor \VersionNotice! HTCondor is developed by
the Center for High Throughput Computing at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison), and
was first installed as a production system in the UW-Madison Computer
Sciences department more than 15 years ago. This HTCondor pool has since
served as a major source of computing cycles to UW faculty and students.
For many, it has revolutionized the role computing plays in their
research. An increase of one, and sometimes even two, orders of
magnitude in the computing throughput of a research organization can
have a profound impact on its size, complexity, and scope. Over the
years, the Center for High Throughput Computing has established collaborations with scientists
from around the world, and it has provided them with access to surplus
cycles (one scientist has consumed 100 CPU years!). Today, our
department's pool consists of more than 700 desktop Unix workstations
and more than 100 Windows machines.
On a typical day, our pool delivers more than 500 CPU days to UW
researchers. Additional HTCondor pools have been established over the
years across our campus and the world. Groups of researchers, engineers,
and scientists have used HTCondor to establish compute pools ranging in
size from a handful to hundreds of workstations. We hope that HTCondor
will help revolutionize your compute environment as well.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


In a nutshell, HTCondor is a specialized batch system 
\index{batch system}
for managing compute-intensive jobs.
Like most batch systems, HTCondor provides a
queuing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme, and resource
classifications.  Users submit their compute jobs to HTCondor, HTCondor puts
the jobs in a queue, runs them, and then informs the user as to the
result.

Batch systems normally operate only with dedicated machines.  Often 
termed compute servers, these dedicated machines are typically owned by
one organization and dedicated to the sole purpose of running compute
jobs.  HTCondor can schedule jobs on dedicated machines.  But unlike traditional 
batch systems, HTCondor is also designed to effectively 
utilize non-dedicated machines to run jobs.  By being told to only
run compute jobs on machines which are currently not being used (no keyboard
activity, low load average, etc.), HTCondor can
effectively harness otherwise idle machines throughout a pool of machines.
This is important because often times the amount of
compute power represented by the aggregate total of all the non-dedicated 
desktop workstations sitting on people's desks throughout the
organization is far greater than the compute power of a dedicated
central resource.

HTCondor has several unique capabilities at its disposal which are geared 
toward effectively utilizing non-dedicated resources that are not owned or
managed by a centralized resource. These include transparent process
checkpoint and migration, remote system calls, and ClassAds.
Read section~\ref{sec:what-is-condor} for a general 
discussion of these features before reading any further.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Matchmaking with ClassAds}
\label{sec:matchmaking-with-classads}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Before you learn about how to submit a job, it is important to
understand how HTCondor allocates resources. 
\index{HTCondor!resource allocation}
Understanding the
unique framework by which HTCondor matches submitted jobs with machines is
the key to getting the most from HTCondor's scheduling algorithm. 

HTCondor simplifies job submission by acting as a matchmaker of ClassAds.
HTCondor's ClassAds
\index{ClassAd}
are analogous to the classified advertising section of the
newspaper. Sellers advertise specifics about what they have to sell,
hoping to attract a buyer. Buyers may advertise specifics about what
they wish to purchase. Both buyers and sellers list constraints that
need to be satisfied.
For instance, a buyer has a maximum spending limit, 
and a seller requires a minimum purchase price.
Furthermore, both want to rank requests to their own advantage.
Certainly a seller would rank
one offer of \$50 dollars higher than a different
offer of \$25.
In HTCondor, users submitting
jobs can be thought of as buyers of compute resources and machine owners
are sellers. 

All machines in a HTCondor pool advertise their attributes,
\index{ClassAd!attributes}
such as
available memory, CPU type and speed, virtual memory size, current
load average, along with other static and dynamic properties.
This machine ClassAd
\index{ClassAd!machine}
also advertises under what conditions it is
willing to run a HTCondor job and what type of job it would prefer. These
policy attributes can reflect the individual terms and preferences by
which all the different owners have graciously allowed their machine to
be part of the HTCondor pool. 
You may
advertise that your machine is only willing to run jobs at night
and when there is no keyboard activity on your machine.
In addition, you may
advertise a preference (rank) for running jobs submitted by you
or one of your co-workers. 

Likewise, when submitting a job, you specify a ClassAd with
your requirements and preferences.
The ClassAd
\index{ClassAd!job}
includes the
type of machine you  wish to use. For instance, perhaps you are
looking for the fastest floating point performance available.
You want HTCondor to rank available machines
based upon floating point performance. Or, perhaps you
care only that the machine has a minimum of 128 Mbytes of RAM.
Or, perhaps you will
take any machine you can get! These job attributes and requirements
are bundled up into a job ClassAd.

HTCondor plays the role of a matchmaker by continuously reading
all the job ClassAds and all the machine ClassAds, 
matching and ranking job ads with machine ads.
HTCondor makes certain that all
requirements in both ClassAds are satisfied. 

%%%%%
\subsection{Inspecting Machine ClassAds with \condor{status}}
%%%%%

\index{HTCondor commands!condor\_status}
Once HTCondor is installed,
you will get a feel for what
a machine ClassAd does by trying
the \Condor{status} command.
Try the \Condor{status} command to get
a summary of information from
ClassAds about the resources available in your pool.
Type \Condor{status} and hit enter to see a summary 
similar to the following:
%\small       too big
%\tiny        too small

\end{verbatim}

\Dots 


The \Condor{status} command has options that summarize machine ads 
in a variety of ways.
For example,
\begin{description}
\item[\Condor{status -available}] shows only machines which are
willing to run jobs now. 
\item[\Condor{status -run}] shows only machines
which are currently running jobs.  
\item[\Condor{status -long}] lists the machine ClassAds for all machines
in the pool.
\end{description}

Refer to the \Condor{status} command 
reference page located on page~\pageref{man-condor-status}
for a complete description of the \Condor{status} command.

The following shows a portion of a machine ClassAd
\index{ClassAd!machine example}
\index{machine ClassAd}
for a single machine: turunmaa.cs.wisc.edu. Some of the listed
attributes are used by
HTCondor for scheduling. Other attributes are for information purposes.
An important point is that \emph{any} of the attributes in a
machine ClassAd can be utilized at job submission time as part of a request
or preference on what machine to use. Additional attributes
can be easily added. For example, your site administrator can
add a physical location attribute to your machine ClassAds.

\section{Road-map for Running Jobs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{job!preparation}
The road to using HTCondor effectively is a short one.  The basics
are quickly and easily learned.

Here are all the steps needed to run a job using HTCondor.
\begin{description}

\item[Code Preparation.]
A job run under HTCondor must be able to 
run as a background batch job.
\index{job!batch ready}
HTCondor runs the program unattended and in the background. 
A program that runs in the background will not be able
to do interactive input and output.
HTCondor can redirect console output (stdout and stderr)
and keyboard input (stdin)
to and from files for you.
Create any needed files that contain
the proper keystrokes needed for program input.
Make certain the program will run correctly with the files.

\item[The HTCondor Universe.]
HTCondor has several 
runtime environments (called a \Term{universe}) from which to choose.
Of the universes, two are likely choices when learning
to submit a job to HTCondor: the standard universe and the vanilla universe.
The standard universe allows a job running under HTCondor to
handle system calls by returning them to the machine where the
job was submitted.
The standard universe also provides the mechanisms necessary
to take a checkpoint and migrate a partially completed job,
should the machine on which the job is executing become
unavailable.
To use the standard universe, it is necessary to
relink the program with the HTCondor library using the
\Condor{compile} command.
The manual page for \Condor{compile} on page~\pageref{man-condor-compile} has details.

The vanilla universe provides a way to run jobs that cannot be
relinked.
There is no way to take a checkpoint or migrate a job executed
under the vanilla universe.
For access to input and output files, jobs must either use a shared
file system, or use HTCondor's File Transfer mechanism.

Choose a universe under which to run the HTCondor program,
and re-link the program if necessary.

\item[Submit description file.]
Controlling the details of a job submission is a
submit description file.
The file contains information
about the job such as what executable to run, the
files to use for keyboard and screen data,
the platform type required to run the program, and
where to send e-mail when the job completes.
You can also tell HTCondor how many times to run a program;
it is simple to run the same program
multiple times with multiple data sets.

Write a submit description file to go with the job, using
the examples provided in section~\ref{sec:sample-submit-files}
for guidance.

\item[Submit the Job.]Submit the program to HTCondor with
the \Condor{submit} command.
\index{HTCondor commands!condor\_submit}

\end{description}

Once submitted, HTCondor does the rest toward running
the job.
Monitor the job's progress with the \Condor{q}
\index{HTCondor commands!condor\_q}
and \Condor{status} commands.
\index{HTCondor commands!condor\_status}
You may modify the order in which HTCondor will run your jobs with
\Condor{prio}. If desired, HTCondor can even inform you in a log file 
every time your job is checkpointed and/or migrated to a different machine. 

When your program completes, HTCondor will tell you
(by e-mail, if preferred) the exit status of your program and various
statistics about its performances, including time used and I/O performed.
If you are using a log file for the job (which is recommended) the exit
status will be recorded in the log file.
You can remove a job from the
queue prematurely with \Condor{rm}. 
\index{HTCondor commands!condor\_rm}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Choosing-Universe}
Choosing an HTCondor Universe}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A \Term{universe} in HTCondor
\index{universe}
\index{HTCondor!universe}
defines an execution environment. 
HTCondor \VersionNotice\ supports several different
universes for user jobs:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Standard
	\item Vanilla
	\item Grid
	\item Java
	\item Scheduler
	\item Local
 	\item Parallel
 	\item VM
\end{itemize}

The \SubmitCmd{universe} under which a job runs
is specified in the submit description file.
If a universe is not specified,
the default is vanilla,
unless your HTCondor administrator has changed the default.
However, we strongly encourage you to specify the universe,
since the default can be changed by your HTCondor administrator,
and the default that ships with HTCondor has changed.

\index{universe!standard}
The standard universe provides migration and reliability, but has some
restrictions on the programs that can be run. 
\index{universe!vanilla}
The vanilla universe provides fewer services, but has very few
restrictions.
\index{universe!Grid}
The grid universe allows users to submit 
jobs using HTCondor's interface.
These jobs are submitted for execution on grid resources.
\index{universe!java}
\index{Java}
\index{Java Virtual Machine}
\index{JVM}
The java universe allows users to run jobs written for the
Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
The scheduler universe allows users to submit lightweight jobs
to be spawned by the program known as a daemon on the submit host itself.
\index{universe!parallel}
The parallel universe is for programs that require multiple machines
for one job.
See section~\ref{sec:Parallel} for more about the Parallel universe.
%\index{universe!Local}
%The local universe . . .
\index{universe!vm}
The vm universe allows users to run jobs where the job is
no longer a simple executable, but a disk image, facilitating
the execution of a virtual machine.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:standard-universe}Standard Universe}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{universe!standard}
In the standard universe, HTCondor provides \Term{checkpointing} and
\Term{remote system calls}.  These features make a job more reliable
and allow it uniform access to resources from anywhere in the pool.
To prepare a program as a standard universe job, it must be relinked
with \Condor{compile}.  Most programs can be prepared as a standard
universe job, but there are a few restrictions.

\index{checkpoint}
\index{checkpoint image}
HTCondor checkpoints a job at regular intervals.
A \Term{checkpoint image} is essentially a snapshot of the current
state of a job. 
If a job must be migrated from one machine to another,
HTCondor makes a checkpoint image, copies the image to the new machine,
and restarts the job continuing the job from where it left off.
If a machine should
crash or fail while it is running a job, HTCondor can restart the job on
a new machine using the most recent checkpoint image.
In this way, jobs
can run for months or years even in the face of occasional computer failures.

\index{remote system call}
\index{shadow}
Remote system calls make a job perceive that it is executing on its home
machine, even though the job may execute on many different machines over its
lifetime.
When a job runs on a remote machine, a second process, called
a \Condor{shadow} runs on the machine where the job was submitted.
\index{condor\_shadow}
\index{agents!condor\_shadow}
\index{HTCondor daemon!condor\_shadow}
\index{remote system call!condor\_shadow}
When the job attempts a system call, the \Condor{shadow} performs
the system call instead and sends the results to the remote
machine.
For example, if a job attempts to open a file that is
stored on the submitting machine,
the \Condor{shadow} will find the file,
and send the data to the machine where
the job is running.

To convert your program into a standard universe job, you must use
\Condor{compile} to relink it with the HTCondor libraries.
Put \Condor{compile} in front of your usual link command.
You do not need to modify the program's source code,
but you do need access to the unlinked object files.
A commercial program that is packaged as a single executable file cannot be
converted into a standard universe job.

For example, if you would have linked the job by executing:
\begin{verbatim}
% cc main.o tools.o -o program
\end{verbatim}

Then, relink the job for HTCondor with:
\begin{verbatim}
% condor_compile cc main.o tools.o -o program
\end{verbatim}

There are a few restrictions on standard universe jobs:

\input{user-man/limitations.tex}


%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Vanilla Universe}
%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{universe!vanilla}
The vanilla universe in HTCondor is intended
for programs which cannot
be successfully re-linked.
Shell scripts are another case where the vanilla universe
is useful.
Unfortunately, jobs run under the vanilla universe cannot checkpoint or use
remote system calls. 
This has unfortunate consequences for a job that is partially
completed 
when the remote machine running a job must be returned
to its owner.
HTCondor has only two choices.  It can suspend the job, hoping to
complete it at a later time,
or it can give up and restart the job \emph{from the beginning} 
on another machine in the pool.

Since HTCondor's remote system call features cannot be used with the
vanilla universe, access to the job's input and output files becomes a
concern.
One option is for HTCondor to rely on a shared file system, such as NFS
or AFS. 
Alternatively, HTCondor has a mechanism for transferring files on behalf
of the user.
In this case, HTCondor will transfer any files needed by a job to the
execution site, run the job, and transfer the output back to the
submitting machine.

Under Unix, HTCondor presumes a shared file system for vanilla jobs. 
However, if a shared file system is unavailable, a user can enable the
HTCondor File Transfer mechanism.
On Windows platforms, the default is to use the File Transfer
mechanism.
For details on running a job with a shared file system, see
section~\ref{sec:shared-fs} on page~\pageref{sec:shared-fs}.
For details on using the HTCondor File Transfer mechanism, see 
section~\ref{sec:file-transfer} on page~\pageref{sec:file-transfer}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Grid Universe}
%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{universe!Grid}
The Grid universe in HTCondor is intended to provide the standard
HTCondor interface to users who wish to start jobs
intended for remote management systems.
Section~\ref{sec:GridUniverse} on page~\pageref{sec:GridUniverse}
has details on using the Grid universe.
The manual page for \Condor{submit}
on page~\pageref{man-condor-submit}
has detailed descriptions of
the grid-related attributes.

%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Java Universe}
%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{universe!Java}

A program submitted to the Java universe may run on any sort of machine
with a JVM regardless of its location, owner, or JVM version.  HTCondor
will take care of all the details such as finding the JVM binary and
setting the classpath.

%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Scheduler Universe}
%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{universe!scheduler}
\index{scheduler universe}

The scheduler universe allows users to submit lightweight jobs
to be run immediately, alongside the \Condor{schedd} daemon on the submit host
itself.
Scheduler universe jobs are not matched with a remote machine,
and will never be preempted.
The job's requirements expression is evaluated against the \Condor{schedd}'s
ClassAd.

Originally intended for meta-schedulers such as \Condor{dagman},
the scheduler universe can also be
used to manage jobs of any sort that must run on the submit host.

However, unlike the local universe, the scheduler
universe does not use a \Condor{starter} daemon to manage the job, and thus
offers limited features and policy support.  The local universe
is a better choice for most jobs which must run on the submit host, as
it offers a richer set of job management features, and is more
consistent with other universes such as the vanilla universe.
The scheduler universe may be retired in the future, in
favor of the newer local universe.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:local-universe}Local Universe}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{universe!local}
\index{local universe}
The local universe allows an HTCondor job to be submitted and
executed with different assumptions for the execution conditions
of the job.
The job does not wait to be matched with a machine.
It instead executes right away, on the machine where the job
is submitted.
The job will never be preempted.
The job's requirements expression is evaluated against the \Condor{schedd}'s
ClassAd.

%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Parallel Universe}
%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{universe!parallel}
\index{parallel universe}
The parallel universe allows parallel programs, such as MPI jobs,
to be run within the opportunistic HTCondor environment.
Please see section~\ref{sec:Parallel} for more details.

%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{VM Universe}
%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{universe!vm}
\index{vm universe}
HTCondor facilitates the execution of VMware and Xen
virtual machines with the vm universe.

Please see section~\ref{sec:vmuniverse} for details.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Submitting a Job}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{job!submitting}
A job is submitted for execution to HTCondor using the
\Condor{submit} command.
\index{HTCondor commands!condor\_submit}
\Condor{submit} takes as an argument the name of a
file called a submit description file.
\index{submit description file}
\index{file!submit description}
This file contains commands and keywords to direct the queuing of jobs.
In the submit description file, HTCondor finds everything it needs
to know about the job.  Items such as the name of the executable to run,
the initial working directory, and command-line arguments to the
program all go into
the submit description file.  \Condor{submit} creates a job
ClassAd based upon the information,
and HTCondor
works toward running the job.

The contents of a submit file
\index{submit description file!contents of}
can save time for HTCondor users.
It is easy to submit multiple runs of a program to
HTCondor. To run the same program 500 times on 500
different input data sets, arrange your data files
accordingly so that each run reads its own input, and each run
writes its own output.
Each individual run may have its own initial
working directory, stdin, stdout, stderr, command-line arguments, and
shell environment.
A program that directly opens its own
files will read the file names to use either from stdin
or from the command line. 
A program that opens a static filename every time
will need to use a separate subdirectory for the output of each run.

The \Condor{submit} manual page 
is on page~\pageref{man-condor-submit} and
contains a complete and full description of how to use \Condor{submit}.
It also includes descriptions of all the commands that may be placed
into a submit description file.
In addition, the index lists entries for each command under the
heading of Submit Commands.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:sample-submit-files}Sample submit description files}  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In addition to the examples of submit description files given
in the 
\Condor{submit} manual page, here are a few more.
\index{submit description file!examples|(}

\subsubsection{Example 1} 

Example 1 is one of the simplest submit description
files possible. It queues up one copy of the program \Prog{foo}
(which had been created by \Condor{compile})
for execution by HTCondor.
Since no platform is specified, HTCondor will use its default,
which is to run the job on a machine which has the
same architecture and operating system as the machine from which it was
submitted. 
No 
\AdAttr{input},
\AdAttr{output}, and
\AdAttr{error}
commands are given in the submit
description file, so the
files \File{stdin}, \File{stdout}, and \File{stderr} will all refer to 
\File{/dev/null}.
The program may produce output by explicitly opening a file and writing to
it.
A log file, \File{foo.log}, will also be produced that contains events
the job had during its lifetime inside of HTCondor.
When the job finishes, its exit conditions will be noted in the log file.
It is recommended that you always have a log file so you know what
happened to your jobs.
\begin{verbatim}
  ####################                                                    
  #

  # Simple condor job description file

  ####################                                                    
                                                                          
  Executable   = foo                                                    
  Universe     = standard                                                    
  Log          = foo.log                                                    
  Queue    
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Example 2}

Example 2 queues two copies of the program \Prog{mathematica}. The
first copy will run in directory \File{run\_1}, and the second will run in
directory \File{run\_2}. For both queued copies, 
\File{stdin} will be \File{test.data},
\File{stdout} will be \File{loop.out}, and
\File{stderr} will be \File{loop.error}.
There will be two sets of files written,
as the files are each written to their own directories.
This is a convenient way to organize data if you
have a large group of HTCondor jobs to run. The example file 
shows program submission of
\Prog{mathematica} as a vanilla universe job.
This may be necessary if the source
and/or object code to \Prog{mathematica} is not available.

The \SubmitCmd{request\_memory} command is included to insure
that the \Prog{mathematica} jobs match with and then execute on
pool machines that provide at least 1 GByte of memory.

\subsubsection{Example 3}

The submit description file for Example 3 queues 150
\index{running multiple programs}
runs of program \Prog{foo} which has been compiled and linked for
LINUX running on a 32-bit Intel processor.
This job requires HTCondor to run the program on machines which have
greater than 32 Mbytes of physical memory, and expresses a
preference to run the program on machines with more than 64 Mbytes.
It also advises HTCondor that this standard universe job will
use up to 28000 Kbytes of memory when running.
Each of the 150 runs of the program is given its own process number,
starting with process number 0.
So, files 
\File{stdin}, \File{stdout}, and \File{stderr} will
refer to \File{in.0}, \File{out.0}, and \File{err.0} for the first run
of the program,
\File{in.1}, \File{out.1},
and \File{err.1} for the second run of the program, and so forth.
A log file containing entries
about when and where HTCondor runs, checkpoints, and migrates processes for
all the 150 queued programs
will be written into the single file \File{foo.log}.

\subsection{\label{sec:user-man-req-and-rank}About Requirements and Rank}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The 
\AdAttr{requirements} and \AdAttr{rank} commands in the submit description file
are powerful and flexible. 
\index{submit commands!requirements}
\index{requirements attribute}
\index{rank attribute}
\index{ClassAd attribute!requirements}
\index{ClassAd attribute!rank}
Using them effectively requires care, and this section presents
those details.

Both \AdAttr{requirements} and \AdAttr{rank} need to be specified 
as valid HTCondor ClassAd expressions, however, default values are set by the
\Condor{submit} program if these are not defined in the submit description file.
From the \Condor{submit} manual page and the above examples, you see
that writing ClassAd expressions is intuitive, especially if you
are familiar with the programming language C.  There are some
pretty nifty expressions you can write with ClassAds.
A complete description of ClassAds and their expressions
can be found in section~\ref{sec:classad-reference} on 
page~\pageref{sec:classad-reference}.

All of the commands in the submit description file are case insensitive, 
\emph{except} for the ClassAd attribute string values.
ClassAd attribute names are
case insensitive, but ClassAd string
values are \emph{case preserving}.

Note that the comparison operators
(\verb@<@, \verb@>@, \verb@<=@, \verb@>=@, and \verb@==@)
compare strings
case insensitively.  The special comparison operators 
\verb@=?=@ and \verb@=!=@
compare strings case sensitively.

A  \SubmitCmd{requirements} or \SubmitCmd{rank} command in
the submit description file may utilize attributes
that appear in a machine or a job ClassAd.
Within the submit description file (for a job) the
prefix \verb@MY.@ (on a ClassAd attribute name)
causes a reference to the job ClassAd attribute,
and the prefix \verb@TARGET.@ causes a reference to 
a potential machine or matched machine ClassAd attribute.

The \Condor{status} command displays
\index{HTCondor commands!condor\_status}
statistics about machines within the pool.
The \Opt{-l} option displays the
machine ClassAd attributes for all machines in the HTCondor pool.
The job ClassAds, if there are jobs in the queue, can be seen
with the \Condor{q -l} command.
This shows all the defined attributes for current jobs in the queue.

A list of defined ClassAd attributes for job ClassAds
is given in the unnumbered Appendix on 
page~\pageref{sec:Job-ClassAd-Attributes}.
A list of defined ClassAd attributes for machine ClassAds
is given in the unnumbered Appendix on 
page~\pageref{sec:Machine-ClassAd-Attributes}.


\subsubsection{\label{rank-examples}Rank Expression Examples}

\index{rank attribute!examples}
\index{ClassAd attribute!rank examples}
\index{submit commands!rank}
When considering the match between a job and a machine, rank is used
to choose a match from among all machines that satisfy the job's
requirements and are available to the user, after accounting for
the user's priority and the machine's rank of the job.
The rank expressions, simple or complex, define a numerical value
that expresses preferences.

The job's \Attr{Rank} expression evaluates to one of three values.
It can be UNDEFINED, ERROR, or a floating point value.
If \Attr{Rank} evaluates to a floating point value,
the best match will be the one with the largest, positive value.
If no \Attr{Rank} is given 
in the submit description file,
then HTCondor substitutes a default value of 0.0 when considering
machines to match.
If the job's \Attr{Rank} of a given machine evaluates
to UNDEFINED or ERROR,
this same value of 0.0 is used.
Therefore, the machine is still considered for a match,
but has no ranking above any other.

A boolean expression evaluates to the numerical value of 1.0
if true, and 0.0 if false.

The following \Attr{Rank} expressions provide examples to
follow.

For a job that desires the machine with the most available memory:
\begin{verbatim}
   Rank = memory
\end{verbatim}

For a job that prefers to run on a friend's machine
on Saturdays and Sundays:
\begin{verbatim}
   Rank = ( (clockday == 0) || (clockday == 6) )
          && (machine == "friend.cs.wisc.edu")
\end{verbatim}

For a job that prefers to run on one of three specific machines:
\begin{verbatim}
   Rank = (machine == "friend1.cs.wisc.edu") ||
          (machine == "friend2.cs.wisc.edu") ||
          (machine == "friend3.cs.wisc.edu")
\end{verbatim}

For a job that wants the machine with the best floating point
performance (on Linpack benchmarks):
\begin{verbatim}
   Rank = kflops
\end{verbatim}
This particular example highlights a difficulty with \Attr{Rank} expression
evaluation as currently defined.
While all machines have floating point processing ability,
not all machines will have the \Attr{kflops} attribute defined.
For machines where this attribute is not defined,
\Attr{Rank} will evaluate to the value UNDEFINED, and
HTCondor will use a default rank of the machine of 0.0.
The \Attr{Rank} attribute will only rank machines where
the attribute is defined.
Therefore, the machine with the highest floating point
performance may not be the one given the highest rank.

So, it is wise when writing a \Attr{Rank} expression to check
if the expression's evaluation will lead to the expected
resulting ranking of machines.
This can be accomplished using the \Condor{status} command with the
\Arg{-constraint} argument.  This allows the user to see a list of
machines that fit a constraint.
To see which machines in the pool have \Attr{kflops} defined,
use
\begin{verbatim}
condor_status -constraint kflops
\end{verbatim}
Alternatively, to see a list of machines where 
\AdAttr{kflops} is not defined, use
\begin{verbatim}
condor_status -constraint "kflops=?=undefined"
\end{verbatim}

For a job that prefers specific machines in a specific order:
\begin{verbatim}
   Rank = ((machine == "friend1.cs.wisc.edu")*3) +
          ((machine == "friend2.cs.wisc.edu")*2) +
           (machine == "friend3.cs.wisc.edu")
\end{verbatim}
If the machine being ranked is \Expr{friend1.cs.wisc.edu}, then the
expression
\begin{verbatim}
   (machine == "friend1.cs.wisc.edu")
\end{verbatim}
is true, and gives the value 1.0.
The expressions
\begin{verbatim}
   (machine == "friend2.cs.wisc.edu")
\end{verbatim}
and
\begin{verbatim}
   (machine == "friend3.cs.wisc.edu")
\end{verbatim}
are false, and give the value 0.0.
Therefore, \Attr{Rank} evaluates to the value 3.0.
In this way, machine \Expr{friend1.cs.wisc.edu} is ranked higher than
machine \Expr{friend2.cs.wisc.edu},
machine \Expr{friend2.cs.wisc.edu}
is ranked higher than 
machine \Expr{friend3.cs.wisc.edu},
and all three of these machines are ranked higher than others.

%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\subsection{Environment Variables}
%%%%%%%%%%%% 

\index{environment variables}
\index{execution environment}
The environment under which a job executes often contains
information that is potentially useful to the job.
HTCondor allows a user to both set and reference environment
variables for a job or job cluster.

Within a submit description file, the user may define environment
variables for the job's environment by using the 
\Opt{environment} command.
See within the \Condor{submit} manual page at
section~\ref{man-condor-submit-environment} for more details about this command.

The submitter's entire environment can be copied into the job
ClassAd for the job at job submission.
The \SubmitCmd{getenv} command within the submit description file
does this,
as described at section~\ref{man-condor-submit-getenv}.

If the environment is set with the \SubmitCmd{environment} command \emph{and}
\SubmitCmd{getenv} is also set to true, values specified with
\SubmitCmd{environment} override values in the submitter's environment,
regardless of the order of the \SubmitCmd{environment} and \SubmitCmd{getenv}
commands.

Commands within the submit description file may reference the
environment variables of the submitter as a job is submitted.
Submit description file commands use \verb@$ENV(EnvironmentVariableName)@
to reference the value of an environment variable.

HTCondor sets several additional environment variables for each executing
job that may be useful for the job to reference.

\begin{itemize}
\item \Env{\_CONDOR\_SCRATCH\_DIR}
\index{\_CONDOR\_SCRATCH\_DIR environment variable}
\index{environment variables!\_CONDOR\_SCRATCH\_DIR}
 gives the directory
where the job may place temporary data files. 
This directory is unique for every job that is run,
and its contents are deleted by HTCondor
when the job stops running on a machine, no matter how the job completes.

\item \Env{\_CONDOR\_SLOT}
\index{\_CONDOR\_SLOT environment variable}
\index{environment variables!\_CONDOR\_SLOT}
gives the name of the slot (for SMP machines), on which the job is run.
On machines with only a single slot, the value of this variable will be
\verb@1@, just like the \AdAttr{SlotID} attribute in the machine's
ClassAd.
This setting is available in all universes.
See section~\ref{sec:Configuring-SMP} for more details about SMP
machines and their configuration.

\item \Env{CONDOR\_VM}
\index{CONDOR\_VM environment variable}
\index{environment variables!CONDOR\_VM}
equivalent to \Env{\_CONDOR\_SLOT} described above, except that it is
only available in the standard universe.
\Note As of HTCondor version 6.9.3, this environment variable is no longer
used.
It will only be defined if the \Macro{ALLOW\_VM\_CRUFT} configuration
variable is set to \Expr{True}.

\item \Env{X509\_USER\_PROXY}
\index{X509\_USER\_PROXY environment variable}
\index{environment variables!X509\_USER\_PROXY}
gives the full path to the X.509 user proxy file if one is
associated with the job.  Typically, a user will specify
\SubmitCmd{x509userproxy} in the submit description file.
This setting is currently available in the
local, java, and vanilla universes.

\item \Env{\_CONDOR\_JOB\_AD}
\index{\_CONDOR\_JOB\_AD environment variable}
\index{environment variables!\_CONDOR\_JOB\_AD}
is the path to a file in the job's scratch directory which contains
the job ad for the currently running job.  The job ad is current
as of the start of the job, but is not updated during the running
of the job.  The job may read attributes and their values out of
this file as it runs, but any changes will not be acted on in any
way by HTCondor.  The format is the same as the output of the
\Condor{q}  \Opt{-l} command.  This environment variable may be particularly
useful in a USER\_JOB\_WRAPPER.

\item \Env{\_CONDOR\_MACHINE\_AD}
\index{\_CONDOR\_MACHINE\_AD environment variable}
\index{environment variables!\_CONDOR\_MACHINE\_AD}
is the path to a file in the job's scratch directory which contains
the machine ad for the slot the currently running job is using.  
The machine ad is current as of the start of the job, but is not updated during the running
of the job.  The format is the same as the output of the
\Condor{status}  \Opt{-l} command.

\item \Env{\_CONDOR\_JOB\_IWD}
\index{\_CONDOR\_JOB\_IWD environment variable}
\index{environment variables!\_CONDOR\_JOB\_IWD}
is the path to the initial working directory the job was born with.

\item \Env{\_CONDOR\_WRAPPER\_ERROR\_FILE}
\index{\_CONDOR\_WRAPPER\_ERROR\_FILE environment variable}
\index{environment variables!\_CONDOR\_WRAPPER\_ERROR\_FILE}
is only set when the administrator has installed a USER\_JOB\_WRAPPER.
If this file exists, HTCondor assumes that the job wrapper has failed
and copies the contents of the file to the StarterLog for the administrator
to debug the problem.

\end{itemize}



%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\subsection{Heterogeneous Submit: Execution on Differing Architectures} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{job!heterogeneous submit}
\index{running a job!on a different architecture}
\index{heterogeneous pool!submitting a job to}
If executables are available for the different platforms of machines
in the HTCondor pool,
HTCondor can be allowed the choice of a larger number of machines
when allocating a machine for a job.
Modifications to the submit description file allow this choice
of platforms.

A simplified example is a cross submission.
An executable is available for one platform, but
the submission is done from a different platform.
Given the correct executable, the \AdAttr{requirements} command in
the submit description file specifies the target architecture.
For example, an executable compiled for a 32-bit Intel processor
running  Windows Vista, submitted
from an Intel architecture running Linux would add the 
\AdAttr{requirement}
\begin{verbatim}
  requirements = Arch == "INTEL" && OpSys == "WINDOWS"
\end{verbatim}
Without this \AdAttr{requirement}, \Condor{submit}
will assume that the program is to be executed on
a machine with the same platform as the machine where the job
is submitted.

Cross submission works for all universes except \Expr{scheduler} and
\Expr{local}.
See section~\ref{sec:Grid-Matchmaking} for how matchmaking works in the
\Expr{grid} universe.
The burden is on the user to both obtain and specify
the correct executable for the target architecture.
To list the architecture and operating systems of the machines
in a pool, run \Condor{status}.

%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\subsubsection{Vanilla Universe Example for Execution on Differing Architectures} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%

A more complex example of a heterogeneous submission
occurs when a job may be executed on
many different architectures to gain full
use of a diverse architecture and operating system pool.
If the executables are available for the different architectures,
then a modification to the submit description file
will allow HTCondor to choose an executable after an
available machine is chosen.

A special-purpose Machine Ad substitution macro can be used in
string
attributes in the submit description file.
The macro has the form
\begin{verbatim}
  $$(MachineAdAttribute)
\end{verbatim}
The \$\$() informs HTCondor to substitute the requested 
\AdAttr{MachineAdAttribute} 
from the machine where the job will be executed.

An example of the heterogeneous job submission
has executables available for two platforms:
RHEL 3 on both 32-bit and 64-bit Intel processors.
This example uses \Prog{povray}
to render images using a popular free rendering engine.

The substitution macro chooses a specific executable after
a platform for running the job is chosen.
These executables must therefore be named based on the
machine attributes that describe a platform.
The executables named \begin{verbatim}
  povray.LINUX.INTEL
  povray.LINUX.X86_64
\end{verbatim}
will work correctly for the macro
\begin{verbatim}
  povray.$$(OpSys).$$(Arch)
\end{verbatim}

The executables or links to executables with this name
are placed into the initial working directory so that they may be
found by HTCondor. 
A submit description file that queues three jobs for this example:

\begin{verbatim}
  ####################
  #
  # Example of heterogeneous submission
  #
  ####################

  universe     = vanilla
  Executable   = povray.$$(OpSys).$$(Arch)
  Log          = povray.log
  Output       = povray.out.$(Process)
  Error        = povray.err.$(Process)

  Requirements = (Arch == "INTEL" && OpSys == "LINUX") || \
                 (Arch == "X86_64" && OpSys =="LINUX") 

  Arguments    = +W1024 +H768 +Iimage1.pov
  Queue 

  Arguments    = +W1024 +H768 +Iimage2.pov
  Queue 

  Arguments    = +W1024 +H768 +Iimage3.pov
  Queue 
\end{verbatim}

These jobs are submitted to the vanilla universe
to assure that once a job is started on a specific platform,
it will finish running on that platform.
Switching platforms in the middle of job execution cannot
work correctly.

There are two common errors made with the substitution macro.
The first is the use of a non-existent \AdAttr{MachineAdAttribute}.
If the specified \AdAttr{MachineAdAttribute} does not
exist in the machine's ClassAd, then HTCondor will place
the job in the held state until the problem is resolved.

The second common error occurs due to an incomplete job set up.
For example, the submit description file given above specifies
three available executables.
If one is missing, HTCondor reports back that an
executable is missing when it happens to match the
job with a resource that requires the missing binary.

%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\subsubsection{Standard Universe Example for Execution on Differing Architectures} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%

Jobs submitted to the standard universe may produce checkpoints.
A checkpoint can then be used to start up and continue execution
of a partially completed job.
For a partially completed job, the checkpoint and the job are specific
to a platform.
If migrated to a different machine, correct execution requires that
the platform must remain the same.

In previous versions of HTCondor, the author of the heterogeneous
submission file would need to write extra policy expressions in the
\AdAttr{requirements} expression to force HTCondor to choose the
same type of platform when continuing a checkpointed job.
However, since it is needed in the common case, this
additional policy is now automatically added
to the \AdAttr{requirements} expression.
The additional expression is added
provided the user does not use
\AdAttr{CkptArch} in the \AdAttr{requirements} expression.
HTCondor will remain backward compatible for those users who have explicitly
specified \AdAttr{CkptRequirements}--implying use of \AdAttr{CkptArch},
in their \AdAttr{requirements} expression.

The expression added when the attribute \AdAttr{CkptArch} is not specified 
will default to

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
  # Added by HTCondor
  CkptRequirements = ((CkptArch == Arch) || (CkptArch =?= UNDEFINED)) && \
                      ((CkptOpSys == OpSys) || (CkptOpSys =?= UNDEFINED))

  Requirements = (<user specified policy>) && $(CkptRequirements)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The behavior of the \AdAttr{CkptRequirements} expressions and its addition to
\AdAttr{requirements} is as follows.
The \AdAttr{CkptRequirements} expression guarantees correct operation
in the two possible cases for a job.
In the first case, the job has not produced a checkpoint.
The ClassAd attributes \Attr{CkptArch} and \Attr{CkptOpSys}
will be undefined, and therefore the meta operator (\verb@=?=@)
evaluates to true.
In the second case, the job has produced a checkpoint.
The Machine ClassAd is restricted to require further execution
only on a machine of the same platform.
The attributes \Attr{CkptArch} and \Attr{CkptOpSys}
will be defined, ensuring that the platform chosen for further
execution will be the same as the one used just before the
checkpoint.

Note that this restriction of platforms also applies to platforms where
the executables are binary compatible.

\subsection{Job Priority}

\index{job!priority}
\index{priority!of a job}
Job priorities allow the assignment of a priority level to
each submitted HTCondor job in order to

\index{HTCondor commands!condor\_prio}
To set a job priority, use the \Condor{prio} command;
see the example in section~\ref{sec:job-prio}, or the
command reference page on page~\pageref{man-condor-prio}.
Job priorities do not impact user priorities in any fashion.
A job priority can be any integer, and higher values are \emph{better}.

Machines are allocated to users based upon a user's priority.
A lower numerical value for user priority means higher priority,
so a user with priority 5 will get more resources than
a user with priority 50.
User priorities in HTCondor can be examined with the \Condor{userprio}
command (see page~\pageref{man-condor-userprio}).
\index{HTCondor commands!condor\_userprio}
HTCondor administrators can set and change individual user priorities
with the same utility.

HTCondor continuously calculates the share of available machines that each
user should be allocated.    This share is inversely related to the ratio
between user priorities.
For example, a user with a priority of 10 will get twice as many
machines as a user with a priority of 20.
The priority of each individual user changes according to
the number of resources the individual is using.
Each user starts out with the best possible priority: 0.5.
If the number of machines a user currently has is greater than 
the user priority,
the user priority will worsen by numerically increasing over time.
If the number of machines is less then the priority,
the priority will improve by numerically decreasing over time. 
The long-term result is fair-share access across all users.
The speed at which HTCondor adjusts the priorities is
controlled with the configuration variable \Macro{PRIORITY\_HALFLIFE},
an exponential half-life value.
The default is one day.
If a user that has user priority of 100 and is
utilizing 100 machines removes all his/her jobs,
one day later that user's
priority will be 50, and two days later the priority will be 25.

HTCondor enforces that each user gets his/her fair share of machines
according to user priority both when allocating machines which become
available and by priority preemption of currently allocated machines.
For instance, if a low priority user is utilizing all available machines
and suddenly a higher priority user submits jobs, HTCondor will
immediately take a checkpoint and vacate jobs belonging to the lower priority
user. This will free up machines that HTCondor will then give over to the
higher priority user. HTCondor will not starve the lower priority user; it
will preempt only enough jobs so that the higher priority user's fair
share can be realized (based upon the ratio between user priorities). To
prevent thrashing of the system due to priority preemption, the HTCondor 
site administrator can define a \Macro{PREEMPTION\_REQUIREMENTS} expression in HTCondor's configuration.
The default expression that ships with HTCondor is configured to only preempt 
lower priority jobs that have run
for at least one hour. So in the previous example, in the worse case it
could take up to a maximum of one hour until the higher priority user
receives a fair share of machines.
For a general discussion of
limiting preemption,
please see
section \ref{sec:Disabling Preemption} of the Administrator's manual.

User priorities are keyed on \Expr{<username>@<domain>}, for example
\Expr{johndoe@cs.wisc.edu}. The domain name to use, if any, is configured by
the HTCondor site administrator.  Thus, user priority and therefore resource
allocation is not impacted by which machine the user submits from or
even if the user submits jobs from multiple machines.

\index{nice job}
\index{priority!nice job}
An extra feature is the ability to submit a job as
a \Term{nice} job (see page~\pageref{man-condor-submit-nice}).
Nice jobs artificially boost the user priority 
by ten million just for the nice job.
This effectively means that nice jobs will only run on
machines that no other HTCondor job (that is, non-niced job) wants.
In a similar fashion, an HTCondor administrator could set
the user priority of any specific HTCondor user very high.
If done, for example, with a guest account,
the guest could only use cycles not wanted by other users of the system.

\subsection{\label{sec:Vacate-Explained}
Details About How HTCondor Jobs Vacate Machines}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{vacate}
\index{preemption!vacate}
When HTCondor needs a job to vacate a machine for whatever reason, it
sends the job an asynchronous signal specified in the \AdAttr{KillSig}
attribute of the job's ClassAd.
The value of this attribute can be specified by
the user at submit time by placing the \Opt{kill\_sig} option in the
HTCondor submit description file.  

If a program wanted to do some special work when required
to vacate a machine, the program may set up a
signal handler to use a trappable signal as an indication
to clean up.
When submitting this job, this clean up signal is specified to be used with
\Opt{kill\_sig}.
Note that the clean up work needs to be quick.
If the job takes too long to go away, HTCondor
follows up with a SIGKILL signal which immediately terminates the
process.

\index{HTCondor commands!condor\_compile}
A job that is linked using \Condor{compile}
and is subsequently submitted into the standard universe, 
will checkpoint and exit upon receipt of a SIGTSTP signal.
Thus, SIGTSTP is
the default value for \AdAttr{KillSig} when submitting to the standard
universe.
The user's code may still checkpoint itself at any time
by calling one of the following functions exported by the HTCondor libraries:
\begin{description}
\item[\Procedure{ckpt()}] Performs a checkpoint and then returns.
\item[\Procedure{ckpt\_and\_exit()}] Checkpoints and exits; HTCondor will then
restart the process again later, potentially on a different machine.
\end{description}

For jobs submitted into the vanilla universe, the default value for
\AdAttr{KillSig} is SIGTERM,
the usual method to nicely terminate a Unix program.

\section{Special Environment Considerations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{AFS}

\index{file system!AFS}
\index{AFS!interaction with}
The HTCondor daemons do not run authenticated to AFS; they do not possess
AFS tokens.
Therefore, no child process of HTCondor will be AFS authenticated.
The implication of this is that you must set file permissions so
that your job can access any necessary files residing on an AFS volume
without relying on having your AFS permissions.

If a job you submit to HTCondor needs to access files residing in AFS,
you have the following choices:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Copy the needed files from AFS to either a local hard disk where 
HTCondor can access them using remote system calls (if
this is a standard universe job), or copy them to an NFS volume.
\item If the files must be kept on AFS, then set a host ACL
(using the AFS \Prog{fs setacl} command) on the subdirectory to
serve as the current working directory for the job.
If this is a standard universe job, then the host ACL needs
to give read/write permission to any process on the submit machine.
If this is a vanilla universe job, then set the ACL such that any host 
in the pool can access the files without being authenticated.
If you do not know how to use an AFS host ACL, ask the person at your 
site responsible for the AFS configuration.
\end{enumerate}

The Center for High Throughput Computing hopes to improve upon how 
HTCondor deals with AFS 
authentication in a subsequent release.

Please see section~\ref{sec:Condor-AFS-Users} on
page~\pageref{sec:Condor-AFS-Users} in the Administrators Manual for
further discussion of this problem.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{NFS}

\index{file system!NFS}
\index{NFS!interaction with}
If the current working directory when a job is submitted
is accessed via an NFS automounter, HTCondor may have problems if the
automounter later decides to unmount the volume before the job has
completed.
This is because \Condor{submit} likely has stored the
dynamic mount point as the job's initial current working directory, and
this mount point could become automatically unmounted by the
automounter.

There is a simple work around.
When submitting the job,
use the submit command \SubmitCmd{initialdir} to point to
the stable access point.
For example,
suppose the NFS automounter is configured to mount a volume at mount point
\File{/a/myserver.company.com/vol1/johndoe}
whenever the directory \File{/home/johndoe} is accessed.
Adding the following line to the
submit description file solves the problem.
\begin{verbatim}
  initialdir = /home/johndoe
\end{verbatim}

\index{NFS!cache flush on submit machine}
\index{ClassAd job attribute!IwdFlushNFSCache}
%As of HTCondor version 7.4.0, 
HTCondor attempts to flush the NFS cache on a submit machine in order to
refresh a job's initial working directory.
This allows files written by the job into an NFS mounted 
initial working directory to be immediately visible on the submit machine.
Since the flush operation can require multiple round trips
to the NFS server, it is expensive.
Therefore, a job may disable the flushing by setting
\begin{verbatim}
  +IwdFlushNFSCache = False
\end{verbatim}
in the job's submit description file.
See page~\pageref{IwdFlushNFSCache-job-attribute} for a definition
of the job ClassAd attribute.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{HTCondor Daemons That Do Not Run as root}

\index{running as root}
\index{daemon!running as root}
HTCondor is normally installed such that the HTCondor daemons have root
permission.
This allows HTCondor to run the \Condor{shadow} 
\index{HTCondor daemon!condor\_shadow}
\index{remote system call!condor\_shadow}
daemon and
the job with the submitting user's UID and file access rights.
When HTCondor
is started as root, HTCondor jobs can access whatever files the
user that submits the jobs can.

However, it is possible that the HTCondor installation 
does not have root access, or
has decided not to run the daemons as root.
That is unfortunate,
since HTCondor is designed to be run as root.
To see if HTCondor is
running as root on a specific machine, use the command
\begin{verbatim}
  condor_status -master -l <machine-name>
\end{verbatim}

where \verb@<machine-name>@ is the name of the specified machine.
This command displays the full \condor{master} ClassAd; if the
attribute \AdAttr{RealUid} equals zero,
then the HTCondor daemons are indeed
running with root access.  If the
\AdAttr{RealUid} attribute is not zero, then the HTCondor daemons do not have
root access.

\Note The Unix program \Prog{ps}
is \emph{not} an effective
method of determining if HTCondor is running with root access.
When using \Prog{ps},
it may often appear that the daemons are
running as the condor user instead of root.
However, note that the \Prog{ps}
command shows the current \emph{effective} owner of the
process, not the \emph{real} owner.  (See the \Cmd{getuid}{2} and
\Cmd{geteuid}{2} Unix man pages for details.)  In Unix, a process
running under the real UID of root may switch its effective UID.
(See the \Cmd{seteuid}{2} man page.)
For security reasons, the daemons
only set the effective UID to root when absolutely necessary,
as it will be to perform a privileged operation.

If daemons are not running with root access, 
make any and all files
and/or directories that the job will touch readable and/or writable by
the UID (user id) specified by the \Attr{RealUid} attribute.
Often this may
mean using the Unix command \verb@chmod 777@
on the directory from which the HTCondor job is submitted.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Job-Lease}
Job Leases}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{job lease}

A \Term{job lease} specifies how long a given job will attempt to run
on a remote resource,
even if that resource loses contact with the submitting machine.
Similarly, it is the length of time the submitting machine will
spend trying to reconnect to the (now disconnected) execution host,
before the submitting machine gives up and tries to claim
another resource to run the job.
The goal aims at run only once semantics,
so that the \Condor{schedd} daemon does not allow the same job
to run on multiple sites simultaneously.

If the submitting machine is alive,
it periodically renews the job lease,
and all is well.
If the submitting machine is dead,
or the network goes down, the job lease will no longer be renewed.
Eventually the lease expires.
While the lease has not expired,
the execute host continues to try to run the job,
in the hope that the submit machine will come back to life
and reconnect.
If the job completes and the lease has not expired, yet the 
submitting machine is still dead,
the \Condor{starter} daemon will wait for a
\Condor{shadow} daemon to reconnect, 
before sending final information on the job,
and its output files.
Should the lease expire, the \Condor{startd} daemon
kills off the \Condor{starter} daemon and user job.

\index{ClassAd job attribute!JobLeaseDuration}
\index{JobLeaseDuration!job ClassAd attribute}
A default value equal to 20 minutes exists for a job's
ClassAd attribute \Attr{JobLeaseDuration}, 
or this attribute may be set in the submit description file,
using \SubmitCmd{job\_lease\_duration},
to keep a job running in the case that the submit side no longer
renews the lease.
There is a trade off in setting the value of \SubmitCmd{job\_lease\_duration}. 
Too small a value,
and the job might get killed before the submitting machine has a
chance to recover.
Forward progress on the job will be lost.
Too large a value,
and an execute resource will be tied up waiting for the job lease to expire.
The value should be chosen based on how long the user is willing to tie up
the execute machines, how quickly submit machines come  back up,
and how much work would be lost if the lease expires,
the job is killed, and the job must start over from its beginning.

As a special case, a submit description file setting of
\begin{verbatim}
 job_lease_duration = 0
\end{verbatim}
as well as utilizing submission other than \Condor{submit}
that do not set \Attr{JobLeaseDuration}
(such as using the web services interface)
results in the corresponding job ClassAd attribute to be explicitly
undefined.
This has the further effect of changing the duration of a claim lease,
the amount of time that the execution machine waits before
dropping a claim due to missing keep alive messages.

\section{Potential Problems}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{\label{sec:renaming-argv}Renaming of argv[0]}

\index{argv[0]!HTCondor use of}
When HTCondor starts up your job, it renames argv[0] (which usually
contains the name of the program) to \condor{exec}.
This is
convenient when examining a machine's processes with the Unix
command \Prog{ps}; the process
is easily identified as an HTCondor job.  

Unfortunately, some programs read argv[0] expecting their own program
name and get confused if they find something unexpected like
\condor{exec}.
