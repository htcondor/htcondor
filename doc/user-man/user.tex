We are pleased to present Condor \VersionNotice! Condor is developed by
the Condor Team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison), and
was first installed as a production system in the UW-Madison Computer
Sciences department nearly 10 years ago. This Condor pool has since
served as a major source of computing cycles to UW faculty and students.
For many, it has revolutionized the role computing plays in their
research. An increase in one, and sometimes even two, orders of
magnitude in the computing throughput of a research organization can
have a profound impact on its size, complexity, and scope. Over the
years, the Condor Team has established collaborations with scientists
from around the world and has provided them with access to surplus
cycles (one of whom has consumed 100 CPU years!). Today, our
department's pool consists of more than 350 desktop UNIX workstations.
On a typical day, our pool delivers more than 180 CPU days to UW
researchers. Additional Condor pools have been established over the
years across our campus and the world. Groups of researchers, engineers,
and scientists have used Condor to establish compute pools ranging in
size from a handful to hundreds of workstations. We hope that Condor
will help revolutionize your compute environment as well.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{What does Condor do?}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


In a nutshell, Condor is a specialized batch system for managing
compute-intensive jobs.  Like most batch systems, Condor provides a
queueing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme, and resource
classifications.  Users submit their compute jobs to Condor, Condor puts
the jobs in a queue, runs them, and then informs the user as to the
result.

Batch systems normally operate only with dedicated machines.  Often 
termed compute servers, these dedicated machines are typically owned by
one organization and dedicated to the sole purpose of running compute
jobs.  Condor can schedule jobs on dedicated machines.  But unlike traditional 
batch systems, Condor is also designed to effectively 
utilize non-dedicated machines to run jobs.  By being told to only
run compute jobs on machines which are currently not being used (no keyboard
activity, no load average, no active telnet users, etc), Condor can
effectively harness otherwise idle machines throughout the network.
This is important because often times the amount of
compute power represented by the aggregate total of all the non-dedicated 
desktop workstations sitting on people's desks throughout the
organization is far greater than the compute power of a dedicated
central resource.

Condor has several unique capabilities at its disposal which are geared 
towards effectively utilizing non-dedicated resources that are not owned or
managed by a centralized resource. These include transparent process
checkpoint and migration, remote system calls, and ClassAds.  Please be
certain to have read section~\ref{sec:what-is-condor} for a general 
discussion about these capabilities before reading any further.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Condor Matchmaking with ClassAds}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Before you start learning about how to submit a job, it is important to
understand how Condor performs resource allocation. Understanding the
unique framework by which Condor matches submitted jobs with machines is
the key to getting the most from Condor's scheduling algorithm. 

Condor is unlike most other batch systems, which typically involve
submitting a job to one of several pre-defined job queues. These
environments typically become both constrained and complicated, as
system administrators scramble to add more queues in response to the
variety of user needs. Likewise, the user is asked to make compromises
and is left with the burden of not only keeping track of which queues
have which properties, but also deciding which queue would be the
optimal one to use for their jobs.

Instead, Condor simply acts as a matchmaker of ClassAds. Condor's
ClassAds are analogous to the classified advertising section of the
newspaper. Sellers advertise specifics about what they have to sell,
hoping to attract a buyer. Buyers may advertise specifics about what
they wish to purchase. Both buyers and sellers may have constraints that
need to be satisfied. For instance, perhaps the buyer is not willing to
spend more than X dollars, and the seller requires to receive a minimum
of Y dollars. Furthermore, both want to rank requests from the other in
such a fashion that is to their advantage. Certainly a seller would rank
a buyer offering \$50 dollars for a service higher than a different
buyer offering \$25 for the same service. In Condor, users submitting
jobs can be thought of as buyers of compute resources and machine owners
are the sellers. 

All machines in the Condor pool advertise their attributes, such as
available RAM memory, CPU type and speed, virtual memory size, current
load average, and many other static and dynamic properties, in a machine
ClassAd. The machine ClassAd also advertises under what conditions it is
willing to run a Condor job and what type of job it would prefer. These
policy attributes can reflect the individual terms and preferences by
which all the different owners have graciously allowed their machine to
be part of the Condor pool. For example, John Doe's machine may
advertise that it is only willing to run jobs at night and when there is
nobody typing at the keyboard. In addition, John Doe's machines may
advertise a preference (rank) for running jobs submitted by either John
Doe or one of his co-workers whenever possible. 

Likewise, when submitting a job, you can specify many different job
attributes, including whatever requirements and preferences for whatever
type of machine you'd like this job to use. For instance, perhaps you're
looking for the fastest floating-point machine available, i.e. you want to
rank matches based upon floating-point performance. Or perhaps you only
care that the machine has a minimum of 128 Meg of RAM. Or perhaps you'll
just take any machine you can get! These job attributes and requirements
are bundled up into a job ClassAd and ``published'' to Condor.

Condor then plays the role of a matchmaker by continuously reading
through all of the job ClassAds and all of the machine ClassAds and
matching and ranking job ads with machine ads, while making certain that all
requirements in both ads are satisfied. 

%%%%%
\subsection{Inspecting Machine ClassAds with \condor{status}}
%%%%%

Now would be a good time to try the \Condor{status} command to get a feel
for what a ClassAd actually looks like.
\Condor{status} displays summarizes and displays information from
ClassAds about the resources available in your pool. If you just type
\Condor{status} and hit enter, you will see a summary of all the machine
ClassAds similar to the following:
\begin{center}
\begin{verbatim}
Name       Arch     OpSys        State      Activity   LoadAv Mem  ActvtyTime

adriana.cs INTEL    SOLARIS251   Claimed    Busy       1.000  64    0+01:10:00

\end{verbatim}
\Dots 
\end{center}


\Condor{status} can summarize machine ads in a wide variety of ways.
For example, \Condor{status -available} shows only machines which are
willing to run jobs now, and \Condor{status -run} shows only machines
which are currently running jobs.  \Condor{status} can also display
other types of ads other than just machine ads; \Condor{status -help}
lists all the options, and/or refer to the \Condor{status} command
reference page located on page~\pageref{man-condor-status}.

To get a feel for what a typical machine ClassAd looks like in its
entirety, use the \Condor{status -l} command.
Figure~\ref{fig:CondorStatusL} shows the complete machine ad for
workstation alfred.cs.wisc.edu. Some of these attributes are used by
Condor itself for scheduling. Other attributes are simply informational.
But the important point is that \textit{any} of these attributes in the
machine ad can be utilized at job submission time as part of a request
or preference on what machine to use. Furthermore, additional attributes
can be easily added; for example, perhaps your site administrator has
added a physical location attribute to your machine ClassAds.

\section{Road-map for running jobs with Condor}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The road to effectively using Condor is short one.  The basics
are quickly and easily learned.  Unlike some other network-cluster
solutions, Condor typically does not require you to make any
changes to your program, even to do more advanced tasks such as
process checkpoint and migration. 

Using Condor can be broken down into the following steps:

\begin{description}

\item[Job Preparation.]First, you will need to prepare your job for
Condor. This involves preparing it to run as a background batch job,
deciding which Condor runtime environment (or \Term{Universe}) to use,
and possibly relinking your program with the Condor library via the
\Condor{compile} command. 

\item[Submit to Condor.]Next, you'll submit your program to Condor via
the \Condor{submit} command. With \Condor{submit} you'll tell Condor
information about the run, such as what executable to run, what
filenames to use for keyboard and screen (stdin and stdout) data, and
where to send email when the job completes. You can also tell Condor how
many times to run a program; many users may want to run the same program
multiple times with multiple different data files. Finally, you'll also
describe to Condor what type of machine you want to run your program. 

\item[Condor Runs the Job.]Once submitted, you'll monitor your job's
progress via the \Condor{q} and \Condor{status} commands, and/or
possibly modify the order in which Condor will run your jobs with
\Condor{prio}. If desired, Condor can even inform you every time your job
is checkpointed and/or migrated to a different machine. 

\item[Job Completion.]When your program completes, Condor will tell you
(via email if preferred) the exit status of your program and how much
CPU and wall clock time the program used. You can remove a job from the
queue prematurely with \Condor{rm}. 

\end{description}  % of Road Map steps


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Job Preparation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Before submitting your program to Condor, you must first make certain
your program is batch ready.  Next you'll need to decide upon a Condor
Universe, or runtime environment, for your job.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Batch Ready}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Condor runs your program unattended and in the background. Make certain
that your program can do this before submitting it to Condor. Condor can
redirect console output (stdout and stderr) and keyboard (stdin) input
to/from files for you, so you may have to create file(s) that contain
the proper keystrokes needed for your file.

It is also very easy to quickly submit multiple runs of your program to
Condor. Perhaps you want to run the same program 500 times on 500
different input data sets. If so, you need to arrange your data files
accordingly so that each run can read its own input, and so one run's
output files do not clobber (overwrite) another run's files. For each
individual run, Condor allows you to easily customize that run's initial
working directory, stdin, stdout, stderr, command-line arguments, or
shell environment. Therefore, if your program directly opens its own
data files, hopefully it can read what filenames to use via either stdin
or the command-line. If your program opens a static filename every time,
you will likely need to make a separate subdirectory for each run to
store its data files into.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Choosing a Condor Universe}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A Universe in Condor defines an execution environment. You can state
which Universe to use for each job in a submit-description file when the
job is submitted. Condor \VersionNotice\ supports three different
program Universes for user jobs:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Standard
	\item Vanilla
	\item PVM
\end{itemize}

If your program is a parallel application written for PVM, then you
would ask Condor for the PVM universe at submit time.  See
section~\ref{sec:PVM} for information on using Condor with PVM jobs.

Otherwise, you need to decide between Standard or Vanilla Universe.
In general, Standard Universe provides more services to your job than
Vanilla Universe and therefore Standard is usually preferable.  But 
Standard Universe also imposes some restrictions on
what your job can do.  Vanilla Universe has very few restrictions, and
can be used when either the Standard Universe's additional services are not
desired or when the job cannot abide by the Standard Universe's
restrictions.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:standard-universe}Standard Universe}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the Standard Universe, which is the default, Condor will
automatically make checkpoints (take a snapshot of its current state) of
the job. So if a Standard Universe job is running on a machine and needs
to leave (perhaps because the owner of the machine returned), Condor
will checkpoint the job and then migrate it to some other idle machine.
Because the job was checkpointed, Condor will restart the job from the
checkpoint and therefore it can continue to run \underline{from where it
left off}. 

Furthermore, Standard Universe jobs can use Condor's \Term{remote system
calls} mechanism, which enables the program to access data files from
any machine in the Condor pool regardless of whether that machine is
sharing a file-system via NFS (or AFS) or if the user has an account
there. Even if your files are just sitting on your local hard-drive, or
in /tmp, Condor jobs can access them.  How it works is when your Condor
job start up on some remote machine, a corresponding \Condor{shadow}
process also starts up on the machine where you submitted the job.
As your job runs on the remote machine, Condor traps hundreds of operating system 
calls (such as calls to open, read, and
write files) and ships them over the network via a remote procedure call
to the \Condor{shadow} process.  The \Condor{shadow} executes the system
call on the submit machine and passes the result back over the network
to your Condor job.  The end result is everything appears to your job
like it is simply running on the submit machine, even as it bounces
around to different machines in the pool.

The transparent checkpoint/migration and remote system calls are highly
desirable services. However, all Standard Universe jobs must be
re-linked with the Condor libraries. Although this is a simple process,
after doing so there are a few restrictions on what the program can do:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item On some platforms, specifically HPUX and Digital Unix
(OSF/1), shared libraries are not supported; therefore on these
platforms applications must be statically linked (Note: shared library
checkpoint support is available on IRIX, Solaris, and LINUX). 
	\item Only single process jobs are supported, i.e. the fork(2), exec(2),
system(3) and similar calls are not implemented.
	\item Signals and signal handlers are supported, but Condor reserves the 
SIGUSR2 and SIGTSTP signals and does not permit their use by user code.
	\item Most interprocess communication (IPC) calls are not supported, i.e. the 
socket(2), send(2), recv(2), and similar calls are not implemented.
	\item All file operations must be idempotent --- read-only and write-only file 
accesses work correctly, but programs which both read and write to the 
same file may not.
	\item Each Condor job that has been checkpointed has an associated 
\Term{checkpoint file} which is approximately the size of the address space of the 
process. Disk space must be available to store the checkpoint file on the 
submitting machine (or on a Condor Checkpoint Server if your site administrator
has set one up).
\end{enumerate}

Although relinking a program for use in Condor's Standard Universe is
very easy to do and typically requires no changes to the program's
source code, sometimes users who wish to utilize Condor do not have
access to their program's source or object code. Without access to
either the source or object code, relinking for the Standard Universe is
impossible. This situation is typical with commercial applications,
which usually only provide a binary executable and only rarely provide
source or object code.

%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Vanilla Universe}
%%%%%%%%%%%%

The Vanilla Universe in Condor is for running any programs which cannot
be successfully re-linked for submission into the Standard Universe.
Shell scripts are another good reason to use the Vanilla Universe.
However, here's the down side: Vanilla jobs cannot checkpoint or use
remote system calls. So, for example, when a user returns to a
workstation running a Vanilla job, Condor can either suspend the job or
restart the job \underline{from the beginning} someplace else.
Furthermore, unlike Standard jobs, Vanilla jobs must rely on some
external mechanism in place (such as NFS, AFS, etc.) for accessing data
files from different machines because Remote System Calls are only
available in the Standard Universe.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Relinking for the Standard Universe}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Relinking a program with the Condor libraries (\condor{rt0.o} and
\condor{syscall\_lib.a}) is a simple one-step process with Condor
\VersionNotice. To re-link a program with the Condor libraries for
submission into the Standard Universe, simply run \Condor{compile}. See
the command reference page for \Condor{compile} on
page~\pageref{man-condor-compile}.

Note that even once your job is re-linked, you can still run your program
outside of Condor directly from the shell prompt as usual.  When you do
this, the following message is printed to remind you that this 
binary is linked with the Condor libraries:
\begin{verbatim}
  WARNING: This binary has been linked for Condor.
  WARNING: Setting up to run outside of Condor...
\end{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Submitting a Job to Condor}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\Condor{submit} is the program for actually submitting jobs to Condor.
\Condor{submit} wants as its sole argument the name of a submit-description 
file which contains commands and keywords to direct the queuing of jobs.
In the submit-description file, you will tell Condor everything it needs
to know about the job.  Items such as the name of the executable to run,
the initial working directory, command-line arguments, etc., all go into
the submit-description file.  \Condor{submit} then creates a new job
ClassAd based upon this information and ships it along with the executable to run 
to the \Condor{schedd} daemon running on your machine.  At that point your job has
been submitted into Condor.

Now please read the \Condor{submit} manual page in the 
Command Reference chapter before you continue; it is on page~\pageref{man-condor-submit} and
contains a complete and full description of how to use \Condor{submit}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Sample submit-description files}  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Now that you have read about \Condor{submit} and have an idea of how it
works, we'll followup with a few additional examples of submit-description files.

\subsubsection{Example 1} 

Example 1 below about the simplest submit-description
file possible. It queues up one copy of the program ``foo'' for execution
by Condor. Condor will attempt to run the job on a machine which has the
same architecture and operating system as the machine from which it was
submitted. Since no input, output, and error commands were given, the
files stdin, stdout, and stderr will all refer to /dev/null. (The
program may produce output by explicitly opening a file and writing to
it.)
\begin{verbatim}
  ####################                                                    
  # 
  # Example 1                                                                       
  # Simple condor job description file                                    
  #                                                                       
  ####################                                                    
                                                                          
  Executable     = foo                                                    
  Queue    
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Example 2}

Example 2 below queues 2 copies of program the program ``mathematica''. The
first copy will run in directory ``run\_1'', and the second will run in
directory ``run\_2''. In both cases the names of the files used for stdin,
stdout, and stderr will be test.data, loop.out, and loop.error,
but the actual files will be different as they are in different
directories. This is often a convenient way to organize your data if you
have a large group of condor jobs to run. The example file submits
``mathematica'' as a Vanilla Universe job, perhaps because the source
and/or object code to program ``mathematica'' was not available and
therefore the re-link step necessary for Standard Universe jobs could not
be performed. 
\begin{verbatim}
  ####################     
  #                       
  # Example 2: demonstrate use of multiple     
  # directories for data organization.      
  #                                        
  ####################                    
                                         
  Executable     = mathematica          
  Universe = vanilla                   
  input   = test.data                
  output  = loop.out                
  error   = loop.error             
                                  
  Initialdir     = run_1         
  Queue                         
                               
  Initialdir     = run_2      
  Queue                     
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Example 3}

The submit-description file Example 3 below queues 150
runs of program ``foo'' which must have been compiled and linked for
Silicon Graphics workstations running IRIX 6.x. Condor will not attempt
to run the processes on machines which have less than 32 megabytes of
physical memory, and will run them on machines which have at least 64
megabytes if such machines are available. Stdin, stdout, and stderr will
refer to ``in.0'', ``out.0'', and ``err.0'' for the first run of this program
(process 0). Stdin, stdout, and stderr will refer to ``in.1'', ``out.1'',
and ``err.1'' for process 1, and so forth. A log file containing entries
about where/when Condor runs, checkpoints, and migrates processes in this
cluster will be written into file ``foo.log''.
\begin{verbatim}

\subsection{More about Requirements and Rank}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

There are a few more things you should know about the powerful
\Opt{Requirements} and \Opt{Rank} commands in the submit-description file.

First of all, both of them need to be valid Condor ClassAd expressions.
From the \Condor{submit} manual page and the above examples, you can see
that writing ClassAd expressions is quite intuitive (especially if you
are familiar with the programming language C).  However, there are some
pretty nifty expressions you can write with ClassAds if you care to read
more about them.  The complete lowdown on ClassAds and their expressions
can be found in section~\ref{classad-reference} on 
page~\pageref{classad-reference}.

All of the commands in the submit-description file are case insensitive, 
\underline{except} for the ClassAd attribute string values that appear in the
ClassAd expressions that you write!  ClassAds attribute names are
case insensitive, but ClassAd string
values are always \underline{case sensitive}.  If you accidently say
\begin{verbatim}
        requirements = arch == "alpha"
\end{verbatim}
instead of what you should have said, which is:
\begin{verbatim}
        requirements = arch == "ALPHA"
\end{verbatim}
you will not get what you want.

So now that you know ClassAd attributes are case-sensitive, how do you
know what the capitalization should be for an arbitrary attribute ?  For
that matter, how do you know what attributes you can use ?  The answer
is you can use any attribute that appears in either a machine or a job
ClassAd.  To view all of the machine ClassAd attributes, simply run \Condor{status -l}.  The \Arg{-l} argument to
\Condor{status} means to display the complete machine ClassAd.  Similarly
for job ClassAds, do a \Condor{q -l} command (Note: you'll have to submit some
jobs first before you can view a job ClassAd).  This
will show you all the available attributes you can play with, along with their
proper capitalization.  

To help you out with what these attributes all signify, below we list
descriptions for the attributes which will be common by default to every
machine ClassAd. Remember that because ClassAds are flexible, the
machine ads in your pool may be including additional attributes specific
to your site's installation/policies.

\subsection{Heterogeneous submit: submit to a different architecture} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%

There are times when you would like to submit jobs across machine
architectures. For instance, let's say you have an Intel machine running
LINUX sitting on your desk. This is the machine where you do all your
work and where all your files are stored. But perhaps the majority of
machines in your pool are Sun SPARC machines running Solaris. You would
want to submit jobs directly from your LINUX box that would run on the
SPARC machines.

This is easily accomplished.  You will need, or course, to create your
executable on the same type of machine where you want your job to run ---
Condor will not convert machine instructions hetrogeneously for you! The
trick is simply what to specify for your \Opt{requirements} command in
your submit-description file.  By default, \Condor{submit} inserts
requirements that will make your job run on the same type of machine you
are submitting from.  To override this, simply state what you want.
Returning to our example, you would put the following into your
submit-description file:
\begin{verbatim}
        requirements = Arch == "SUN4x" && OpSys == "SOLARIS251"
\end{verbatim}
Just run \Condor{status} to display the Arch and OpSys values for any/all 
machines in the pool.

\section{Priorities in Condor}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Condor has two independent priority controls: \Term{job}
priorities and \Term{user} priorities.  

\subsection{Job Priority}

Job priorities allow you to assign a priority level to each of your jobs in order to
control their order of execution.  To do this, use the \Condor{prio}
command --- see the example in section~\ref{sec:job-prio}, or the
command reference page on page~\pageref{man-condor-prio}.  Job
priorities, however, do not impact user priorities in any fasion.  No matter what you
set a job's priority to be, it will not alter your user priority in
relation to other users.  Job priorities range from -20 to +20, with +20
being the best and -20 the worst.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:user-priority-explained}User priority}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Machines are allocated to users based upon that user's priority. User
priorities in Condor can be examined with the \Condor{userprio}
command (see page~\pageref{man-condor-userprio}),
and Condor administrators can set and edit individual user priorities
with the same utility. A lower numerical user priority value means
higher priority, so a user with priority 5 will get more resources than
a user with priority 50.  

Condor continuously calculates the share of available machines that each
user should be allocated.    This share is inversely related to the ratio
between user priorities; for example, a user with a priority of 10 will
get twice as many machines as a user with a priority of 20. The priority
of each individual user changes according to the number of resources he
is using. Each user starts out with a priority of .5 (the best
priority allowed).  If the number of machines a user currently has is greater than his
priority, the priority will numerically increase (worsen) over time, and if it is less then
the priority, the priority will numerically decrease (improve) over time. 
The long-term result is fair-share access across all users.  The speed
at which Condor adjusts the priorities is controlled via an exponential
half-life value (parameter \Macro{PRIORITY\_HALFLIFE} which can be adjusted
by the site administrator) which has a
default of one day.  So if a user with a user priority of 100 is
utilizing 100 machines and then deletes all his/her jobs, one day later that user's
priority will  50, two days later the priority will be 25, etc. 

Condor enforces that each user gets his/her fair share of machines
according to user priority both when allocating machines which become
available and by priority preemption of currently allocated machines.
For instance, if a low priority user is utilizing all available machines
and suddenly a higher priority user submits jobs, Condor will
imediately checkpoint and vacate jobs belonging to the lower priority
user. This will free up machines that Condor will then give over to the
higher priority user. Condor will not starve the lower priority user; it
will preempt only enough jobs so that the higher priority user's fair
share can be realized (based upon the ratio between user priorities). To
prevent thrashing of the system due to priority preemption, the Condor 
site administrator can define a \Macro{PREEMPTION\_HOLD} expression in Condor's configuration.
The default expression that ships with Condor is configured to only preempt 
lower priority jobs that have run
for at least one hour. So in the previous example, in the worse case it
could take up to a maximum of one hour until the higher priority user
receives his fair share of machines. 

User priorities are keyed on ``username@domain'', for example
``johndoe@cs.wisc.edu''. (The domainname to use, if any, is also configured by
the Condor site administrator).  Thus, user priority and therefore resource
allocation is not impacted by which machine the user submits from or
even if the user submits jobs from multiple machines.

Finally, any job submitted to Condor can be specified as a ``nice'' job at 
the time the job is submitted (see page~\pageref{man-condor-submit-nice}).
Nice jobs will artificially have their numerical priority boosted by
over one million. This effectively means that nice jobs will only run on
machines that no other Condor job (i.e. non-niced job) wants. Similarly,
the Condor administrators could set the numerical priority of any
individual Condor user, such as a guest account, so that these guest
accounts would only use cycles not wanted by other users of the system.

\section{\label{sec:Vacate-Explained}
More about how Condor vacates a job}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

When Condor needs to vacate a job from a machine for whatever reason, it
sends the job an asynchronous signal specified in the ``KillSig''
attribute of the job's classad.  The value of this attribute can be specified by
the user at submit time by placing the \Arg{kill\_sig} command in the
\Condor{submit} submit-description command file.  

If a program wanted to do some special work each time
Condor kicks them off a machine, all it would need to do is setup a
signal handler for some trappable signal as a ``cleanup'' signal.  When
submitting this job, specify this cleanup signal to use with
\Arg{kill\_sig}.  However, whatever cleanup work the job does had better be quick
--- if the job takes too long to go away after Condor tells it to do so, Condor
follows up with a SIGKILL signal which immediatly terminates the
process.

A job that linked with the Condor libraries via the \Condor{compile}
command and subsequently submitted into the Standard Universe 
will checkpoint and exit upon receit of a SIGTSTP signal.  Thus, SIGTSTP is
the default value for KillSig when submitting into the Standard
Universe.  However, the user's code can checkpoint itself at any time
by calling one of the following functions exported by the Condor libraries:
\begin{description}
\item[ckpt()] Will perform a checkpoint and then return
\item[ckpt\_and\_exit()] Will checkpoint and exit; Condor will then
restart the process again later, potentially on a different machine
\end{description}

For jobs submitted into the Vanilla Universe, the default value for
KillSig is SIGTERM, which is the usual method to nicely terminate a
program in Unix.

\section{Special Environment Considerations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{AFS}

The Condor daemons do not run authenticated to AFS; they do not possess
an AFS token, and therefore no child process of Condor will be AFS
authenticated either. This means that you must set file permissions so
that your job can access any necessary files residing on an AFS volume
during its run without relying on having your AFS permissions.

So, if a job you submit to Condor needs to access files residing in AFS,
you have the following choices:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Copy the files needed off of AFS to either a local hard disk where Condor 
can access them via remote system calls (if
this is a Standard Universe job), or copy them to an NFS volume.
\item If you must keep the files on AFS, then you need to set a host ACL
(using the AFS ``fs setacl'' command) on the subdirectory which will
serve as the current working directory for the job.  If the job is a
Standard Universe job, then the host ACL needs to give read/write permission
to any process on the submit machine.  If the job is a Vanilla Universe
job, then you need to set the ACL such that any host in the pool can
access the files without being authenticated.  If you do not know how to
use an AFS host ACL, please ask whomever at your site is responsible for the
AFS configuration.
\end{enumerate}

How Condor deals with AFS authentication is something the Condor Team
hopes to improve in a subsequent release.

Please also see section~\ref{sec:Condor-AFS-Users} on
page~\pageref{sec:Condor-AFS-Users} in the Administrators Manual for
more discussion about this problem.

\subsection{NFS Automounter}

If your current working directory when you run \Condor{submit} is
accessed via an NFS automounter, Condor may have problems if the
automounter later decides to unmount the volume before your job has
completed.  This is because \Condor{submit} likely has stored the
dynamic mount point as the job's initial current working directory, and
this mount point could become automatically unmounted by the
automounter.

There is a simple workaround: When submitting your job, use the 
\Arg{initialdir} command in your submit-description file to point to
the stable access point.  For example,
say the NFS automounter is configured to mount a volume at mount point
/a/myserver.company.com/vol1/johndoe whenever the directory /home/johndoe is
accessed.  In this example case, simply add the following line to your \Condor{submit}
submit-description file:
\begin{verbatim}
        initialdir = /home/johndoe
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Condor Daemons running as Non-root}

Condor is normally installed such that the Condor daemons have root
permission.  This allows Condor to run the \condor{shadow} process and
your job process with your UID and file access rights.  When Condor
is started as root, your Condor jobs can access whatever files you can.

However, it is possible that whomever installed Condor decided not to
run the daemons as root, or did not have root access.  That's a shame, 
since Condor is really designed to be run as root.  To see if Condor is
running as root on a given machine, enter the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
        condor_status -master -l <machine-name>
\end{verbatim}

where \Opt{machine-name} is the name of the machine you want to
inspect.  This command will display a \condor{master} ClassAd; if the
attribute ``RealUid'' equals zero, then the Condor daemons are indeed
running with root access and you can skip this section.  If the
``RealUid'' attribute is not zero, then the Condor daemons do not have
root access, and you should read on.

Please realize that using ``ps'' is \underline{not} an effective
method of determining if Condor is running with root access.  When
using the "ps" command, it may often appear that the daemons are
running as the condor user instead of root.  However, note that the
``ps'' command shows the current \emph{effective} owner of the
process, not the \emph{real} owner.  (See the \Cmd{getuid}{2} and
\Cmd{geteuid}{2} Unix man pages for details.)  In Unix, a process
running under the real uid of root may switch its effective uid.  (See
the \Cmd{seteuid}{2} man page.)  For security reasons, the daemons
only set effective uid to root when absolutely necessary (to perform a
privileged operation).



If they are not running with root access, you need to make any/all files
and/or directories that your job will touch readable and/or writable by
the UID (user id) specified by the RealUid attribute.  Often this may
mean doing a ``chmod 777'' on the directory where you submit your Condor
job.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Potential Problems}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Renaming of argv[0]}

When Condor starts up your job, it renames argv[0] (which usually
contains the name of the program) to ``\condor{exec}''.  This is
conveinent when examining a machine's processes with ``ps''; the process
is easily identified as a Condor job.  

Unfortunately, some programs read argv[0] expecting their own program
name and get confused if they find something unexpected like
\condor{exec}.
