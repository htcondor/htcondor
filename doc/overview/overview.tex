For many research and engineering projects, the quality of the research
or the product is heavily dependent upon the quantity of computing
cycles available.
It is not uncommon to find problems that require weeks
or months of computation to solve.
Scientists and engineers engaged in
this sort of work need a computing environment that delivers large
amounts of computational power over a long period of time.
Such an environment is called a High-Throughput Computing (HTC) environment.
\index{High-Throughput Computing (HTC)}
\index{HTC (High-Throughput Computing)}
In contrast, High Performance Computing (HPC)
\index{High-Performance Computing (HPC)}
\index{HPC (High-Performance Computing)}
environments deliver a
tremendous amount of compute power over a short period of time.
HPC environments are often measured in terms of FLoating point Operations
Per Second (FLOPS). 
A growing community is not concerned about operations per second,
but operations per month or per year.
Their problems are of a much larger scale.
They are
more interested in how many jobs they can complete over a long period of
time instead of how fast an individual job can complete.

The key to HTC is to efficiently harness the use of all available
resources. Years ago, the engineering and scientific community relied on
a large, centralized mainframe or a supercomputer to do
computational work. 
A large number of individuals and groups needed
to pool their financial resources to afford such a machine.
Users had to wait for their turn on the mainframe, 
and they had a limited amount of time allocated.
While this environment was inconvenient for users,
the utilization of the mainframe was high;
it was busy nearly all the time.

As computers became smaller, faster, and cheaper, 
users moved away from centralized mainframes and purchased personal desktop
workstations and PCs.
An individual or small group could afford a
computing resource that was available whenever they wanted it.
The personal computer is slower than the large centralized machine,
but it provides exclusive access.
Now, instead of one giant computer for a large institution,
there may be hundreds or thousands of personal computers.
This is an environment of distributed ownership,
\index{distributed ownership!of machines}
where individuals throughout an organization own their own resources.
The total computational power of the institution as a whole may rise
dramatically as the result of such a change,
but because of distributed ownership,
individuals have not been able to capitalize on the institutional growth of
computing power.
And, while distributed ownership is more convenient for the users,
the utilization of the computing power is lower.
Many personal desktop
machines sit idle for very long periods of time while their owners are
busy doing other things (such as being away at lunch, in meetings,
or at home sleeping). 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{\label{sec:what-is-condor}HTCondor's Power}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

HTCondor is a software system that creates a High-Throughput Computing
(HTC) environment.
It effectively utilizes the computing power of workstations that
communicate over a network.
HTCondor can manage a dedicated cluster of workstations.
Its power comes from the
ability to effectively harness non-dedicated,
preexisting resources under distributed ownership. 
\index{distributed ownership!of machines}

A user submits the job to HTCondor.
HTCondor finds an available machine on the network and begins
running the job on that machine.
HTCondor has the capability to detect that a machine running a HTCondor job
is no longer available (perhaps because the owner of the machine
came back from lunch and started typing on the keyboard).
It can checkpoint 
\index{checkpoint}
the job and move (migrate)
\index{migration}
the jobs to a different machine which would otherwise be idle.
HTCondor continues the job on the new machine from
precisely where it left off.

In those cases where HTCondor can checkpoint and migrate a job,
HTCondor makes it easy to maximize the number of machines which can run
a job.
In this case, there is no requirement for machines to
share file systems (for example, with NFS or AFS),
so that machines across an entire enterprise can run a job,
including machines in different administrative domains.

HTCondor can be a real time saver when a job
must be run many (hundreds of) different times,
\index{job!multiple data sets}
perhaps with hundreds of different data sets.
With one command, all of the hundreds of jobs are submitted to HTCondor.
Depending upon the number of machines in the HTCondor pool,
dozens or even hundreds of otherwise idle machines
can be running the job at any given moment.

HTCondor does not require an account (login) on machines where it runs a job.
HTCondor can do this because of its \Term{remote system call}
\index{remote system call}
technology,
which traps
library calls for such operations as reading or writing from disk
files.
The calls are transmitted over the network to be performed on the machine
where the job was submitted.

\index{HTCondor!resource management}
\index{resource!management}
HTCondor provides powerful resource management by
match-making resource
\index{matchmaking}
owners with resource consumers.
This is the cornerstone of a successful HTC environment.
Other compute cluster resource management
systems attach properties to the job queues themselves,
resulting in user confusion over which queue to use as well as administrative
hassle in constantly adding and editing queue properties to satisfy user
demands.
HTCondor implements 
\Term{ClassAds},
\index{ClassAd}
a clean design that simplifies the user's submission of jobs.

ClassAds work in a fashion similar to the newspaper classified
advertising want-ads. All machines in the HTCondor pool advertise their
resource properties, both static and dynamic,
such as available RAM memory, CPU type, CPU speed,
virtual memory size, physical location, and current load average,
in a \Term{resource offer} ad.
\index{resource!offer}
A user specifies a \Term{resource request} ad
\index{resource!request}
when submitting a job.
The request defines both the required and a desired set of properties
of the resource to run the job.
HTCondor acts as a broker by matching and ranking resource
offer ads with resource request ads, making certain that all
requirements in both ads are satisfied.
During this match-making process,
HTCondor also considers several layers of priority values:
the priority the user assigned to the resource request ad,
the priority of the user which submitted the ad,
and desire of
machines in the pool to accept certain types of ads over others.

\section{Exceptional Features}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{description}
	\item[Checkpoint and Migration.] Where programs can be
linked with HTCondor libraries, users of HTCondor may be assured that
their jobs will eventually complete,
even in the ever changing environment that HTCondor
utilizes.
As a machine running a job submitted to HTCondor
becomes unavailable,
the job can be check pointed.
\index{checkpoint}
The job may continue after migrating 
\index{migration}
to another machine.
HTCondor's checkpoint feature 
\index{checkpoint!periodic}
periodically checkpoints a job even in lieu of migration in order to
safeguard the accumulated computation time on a job from being lost in the
event of a system failure, such as the machine being shutdown or a crash.
	\item[Remote System Calls.] 
\index{remote system call}
Despite running jobs on remote machines,
the HTCondor standard universe execution
mode preserves the local execution environment
via remote system calls. Users do not have to worry
about making data files available to remote workstations or even
obtaining a login account on remote workstations before HTCondor executes
their programs there. The program behaves under HTCondor as if it were
running as the user that submitted the job on the workstation where it
was originally submitted, no matter on which machine it really ends up
executing on.
	\item[No Changes Necessary to User's Source Code.] No special
programming is required to use HTCondor.
HTCondor is able to run non-interactive programs.
The checkpoint and migration of
programs by HTCondor is transparent and automatic, as is the use of
remote system calls.
If these facilities are desired, the user only
re-links the program.  The code is neither recompiled nor changed.
	\item[Pools of Machines can be Hooked Together.] Flocking is
a feature of HTCondor that allows jobs submitted within a first pool of
HTCondor machines to execute on a second pool.
The mechanism is flexible, following requests from the job
submission,
while allowing the second pool, or a subset of machines within
the second pool to set policies over the conditions under
which jobs are executed.
	\item[Jobs can be Ordered.] The ordering of job execution
required by dependencies among jobs in a set is easily handled.
The set of jobs is specified using a directed acyclic graph,
where each job is a node in the graph.
Jobs are submitted to HTCondor following the dependencies given
by the graph.
	\item[HTCondor Enables Grid Computing.] As grid computing
becomes a reality, HTCondor is already there.
The technique of glidein allows jobs submitted to HTCondor
to be executed on grid machines in various locations worldwide.
As the details of grid computing evolve, so does HTCondor's
ability, starting with Globus-controlled resources.
	\item[Sensitive to the Desires of Machine Owners.] The
owner of a machine has complete priority over the use
of the machine.
An owner is generally happy to let others compute on
the machine while it is idle, but wants it back
promptly upon returning. The owner does not want to take special
action to regain control. HTCondor handles this automatically. 
	\item[ClassAds.]The ClassAd mechanism 
\index{ClassAd}
in HTCondor provides an extremely
flexible, expressive framework for matchmaking
resource requests with resource offers.
Users can easily request both job requirements and job desires.
For example, a user can require that a job run on a machine
with 64 Mbytes of RAM,
but state a preference for 128 Mbytes, if available.
A workstation owner
can state a preference that the workstation runs jobs
from a specified set of users. 
The owner can also require that there be no interactive workstation
activity detectable at certain hours before HTCondor could
start a job.
Job requirements/preferences and resource availability constraints can be
described in terms of powerful expressions, resulting in
HTCondor's adaptation to nearly any desired policy.

\section{\label{sec:current-limitations}Current Limitations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{description}

\index{HTCondor!limitations, under UNIX}
	\item[Limitations on Jobs which can Checkpointed] Although HTCondor can schedule and
run any type of process, HTCondor does have some limitations on jobs that it can
transparently checkpoint and migrate:

\input{user-man/limitations.tex}

	Note: these limitations \emph{only} apply to jobs which HTCondor
has been asked to transparently checkpoint.  If job checkpointing is not
desired, the limitations above do not apply.

	\item[Security Implications.] HTCondor does a significant amount of
	work to prevent security hazards, but loopholes are known to exist.
	HTCondor can be instructed to run user programs only as the UNIX
	user nobody, a user login which traditionally has very 
	restricted access.
	But even with access solely as user nobody,
	a sufficiently malicious individual could do such things as fill up
	\File{/tmp} (which is world writable) and/or gain read access to
	world readable files.
	Furthermore, where the security of machines in the pool is a
	high concern, 
	only machines where the UNIX user root on that machine can be
	trusted should be admitted into the pool.
	HTCondor provides the administrator with extensive security mechanisms 
	to enforce desired policies.

	\item[Jobs Need to be Re-linked to get Checkpointing and Remote System Calls] Although 
typically no source code changes are required,
HTCondor requires
that the jobs be re-linked with the HTCondor libraries to take
advantage of checkpointing and remote system calls. This often
precludes commercial software binaries from taking advantage of these services
because commercial packages rarely make their object code
available. 
HTCondor's other services are still available for these commercial packages.

The HTCondor software periodically sends short messages
to the HTCondor Project developers at the University of Wisconsin,
reporting totals of machines and jobs in each running HTCondor system.
An example of such a message is given below.

The HTCondor Project uses these collected reports to publish
summary figures and tables, such as the total of HTCondor systems
worldwide, or the geographic distribution of HTCondor systems.
This information helps the HTCondor Project to understand
the scale and composition of HTCondor in the real world
and improve the software accordingly.

The HTCondor Project will not use these reports to publicly
identify any HTCondor system or user without permission.
The HTCondor software does not collect or report any personal
information about individual users.

We hope that you will contribute to the development of HTCondor
through this reporting feature.
However, you are free to disable it at any time by
changing the configuration variables \Macro{CONDOR\_DEVELOPERS}
and \Macro{CONDOR\_DEVELOPERS\_COLLECTOR},
both described in section \ref{param:CondorDevelopers} of this manual.
