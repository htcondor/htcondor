\section{\label{sec:History-6-8}Stable Release Series 6.8}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is a stable release series of Condor.
It is based on the 6.7 development series.
All new features added or bugs fixed in the 6.7 series are available
in the 6.8 series.
As usual, only bug fixes (and potentially, ports to new platforms)
will be provided in future 6.8.x releases.
New features will be added in the forthcoming 6.9.x development series.

%%%%%%
% we need a summary of major new features since 6.6.x here.  trying to
% sort through the 21 different 6.7.x releases and all the new
% features is a huge amount of noise.  people just want to see a
% summary of the major new functionality.
% \Todo
%%%%%%

The 6.8.x series supports a different set of platforms than 6.6.x.
Please see the updated table of available platforms in
section~\ref{sec:Availability} on page~\pageref{sec:Availability}.

The details of each version are described below.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-6-8-3}Version 6.8.3}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Added \MacroNI{JOB\_INHERITS\_STARTER\_ENVIRONMENT}.  When set
to true, this causes jobs to inherit all environment variables from
\Condor{starter}.  This is useful for glidein jobs that need to access
environment variables from the batch system running the glidein daemons.
The default for this configuration setting is false, so existing behavior
is unchanged.  This feature does not apply to standard and pvm universe
jobs.

\item Changed the default UDP recieve buffer for the
\Condor{collector} from 1M to 10M.  This value can be configured with
the (existing) COLLECTOR\_SOCKET\_BUFSIZE parameter.

\Note For some Linux distributions, it may be neccessary to configure
a larger value than the default; this parameter is
/proc/sys/net/core/rmem\_max .  You can see the values that the
\Condor{collector} actually used by enabling D\_FULLDEBUG for the
collector and looking at the log line that looks like this:

Reset OS socket buffer size to 2048k (UDP), 255k (TCP).

\item Added a new configuration parameter to control the size of the
TCP send buffers for the \Condor{collector}.  This parameter used to
be the same as COLLECTOR\_SOCKET\_BUFSIZE.  The new parameter is
COLLECTOR\_TCP\_SOCKET\_BUFSIZE, and defaults to 128K.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug in the \Condor{startd} where it could die with
  SIGABRT when a \Condor{starter} exited under certain rare
  circumstances.
  The bug seems to have been most likely to appear on x86\_64 Linux
  machines, but could potentially affect all platforms.

\item Fixed a problem with \condor{history} when running with quill enabled
which caused it to allocate an unbounded amount of memory.

\item Fixed a problem with \condor{q} when running with quill which caused
it to silently truncate the printing of the job queue.

\item Fixed a bug in the \condor{gridmanager} that caused the following
configuration files parameters to be ignored for grid-type condor and
nordugrid jobs: \MacroNI{GRIDMANAGER\_RESOURCE\_PROBE\_INTERVAL},
\MacroNI{GRIDMANAGER\_MAX\_PENDING\_SUBMITS\_PER\_RESOURCE}, and
\MacroNI{GRIDMANAGER\_MAX\_SUBMITTED\_JOBS\_PER\_RESOURCE}.

\item Fixed a bug in \condor{run} that caused it to abort on non-fatal
warnings from \condor{submit} and print incorrect error messages.

\item Fixed a bug in the \condor{gridmanager} dealing with grid-type gt4
grid universe jobs. If the job's standard output or error wasn't specified
in the job ad, the \condor{gridmanager} would create an improper GRAM
RSL string, causing the job to fail.

\item Fixed a bug in the \condor{gridmanager} that could cause it to
delegate the wrong credential when refreshing the credentials for a
grid-type gt4 grid universe job.

\item The \condor{gridmanager} could get into a state where it would no
longer start up Globus jobmanagers for grid-type gt2 grid universe jobs
if previous requests failed due to connection errors. This bug has been
fixed.

\item The \Condor{c-gahp} now properly exits when the pipe to its parent
goes away. Before, it would fill its log with large amounts of useless
messages before exiting several minutes later.

\item Fixed a bug where a problem opening standard input, output, or error
the standard universe might generate an incorrect warning in the 
\Condor{shadow}'s log.

\item The \condor{gridmanager} now recovers properly when a proxy refresh
fails for a gt2 grid universe job in stage-out state. Before, the job
would become held with a hold reason of ``Globus error 3: an I/O operation
failed''.

\item A number of fixes to minor typos and misformatting in Condor's log files.

\item When \MacroNI{REQUEST\_CLAIM\_TIMEOUT} was reached and \Condor{schedd}
failed to contact \Condor{startd} to release the claim, the schedd would
periodically try releasing the claim indefinitely, possibly resulting in
a lengthy communication delay each time.

\item Under Windows, condor daemons such as \Condor{schedd} were sometimes
limiting their use of pending connect operations more than they should
have.  This would result in the message, ``file descriptor safety level
exceeded''.

\item \Condor{fetchlog} no longer allows or documents the -dagman option.
The option's appearance was an error.  The option never worked.

\item \Condor{schedd} ensures that the initial job queue log file
contains a sequence number for use by Quill.  This fixes a case in
which no sequence number was inserted, because the initial rotation of
this (empty) file failed.  Quill also now reports exactly what the
problem is if it reads a job queue log in this state, rather than
simply crashing.  This problem has so far only been observed under
Windows.

\item Fixed a problem on Windows where, when submitting a job with a
sandbox (for example, using the \Opt{-s} or \Opt{-r} option to
\Condor{submit}), an erroneous file permissions check in the
\Condor{schedd} would result in a failed submission.

\item \Condor{startd} would crash shortly after startup if the
\MacroNI{RANK} expression contained any use of the unary minus
operator.  This patch should also fix any other cases where Condor
daemons crashed due to the use of the unary minus operator in ClassAd
expressions.

\item Stork now writes a terminated event to the user log when it removes
a transfer job from its queue because of failures to invoke a transfer
module. Without this event, DAGMan would not notice that these jobs had
left the queue.

\item Fixed a problem where the \Condor{schedd} on Windows would
incorrectly reject a job if the client provided an \Attr{Owner}
attribute that was correct but differed in case from the authenticated
name. This bug was thought to have been fixed in Condor 6.8.0.

\item Fixed problems with \Condor{store\_cred} behaving strangely when
storing or removing a user name that is some initial substring of
``condor\_pool''. Specifying such a username would be incorrectly
interpreted as equivalent to specifying the \Opt{-c} option.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-6-8-2}Version 6.8.2}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item Condor now uses Globus 4.0.3 for GSI, GRAM, and GridFTP support.
This includes a patch for the OpenSSL vulnerability detailed in 
CVE-2006-4339 and \URL{http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv\_20060905.txt}.
It also includes fixes for Globus Bugzilla 4689 
(\URL{http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show\_bug.cgi?id=4689}) and a 
bug that can cause duplicate UUIDs to be generated for WS GRAM jobs.

\item The \Condor{schedd} daemon no longer forks separate processes to 
change ownership of job directories in the spool.
Previously on Unix-like systems, this would create a
new process before a job started running and after it finished running.   Some
sites with very busy \Condor{schedd} daemons were encountering scaling problems.

\end{itemize}

\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Because, by default, the \Condor{startd} daemon references the job
ClassAd attribute \AdAttr{NumCkpts}, Condor's default configuration
will now round up the value of \AdAttr{NumCkpts}, in order to improve 
matchmaking performance.  See the entry on \Macro{SCHEDD\_ROUND\_ATTR}
in section~\ref{param:ScheddRoundAttr}.

\item Enhanced the RHEL3 x86\_64 port of Condor to include the standard
universe.

% Gnats PR 757
\item \Condor{submit\_dag} \Opt{-f} no longer deletes the
\File{dagman.out} file.  \Condor{submit\_dag} without the \Opt{-f}
option will now submit a DAGMan run even if the \File{dagman.out}
file exists.  In this case, the file will be appended to.

\item Added a property to the Windows installer program to determine
whether the Condor service will be started after installation. The
property name is STARTSERVICE, and the default value is ``Y''.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item A bug caused the \Condor{master} daemon to kill
only immediate children within the process tree,
upon an abnormal exit of the \Condor{master} daemon. 
The \Condor{master} daemon now kills all descendant processes.

\item Fixed a bug where if the file system was full, the debugging log
files (for example \File{SchedLog}) would silently lose messages.  Now,
if the disk is full, the Condor daemons will 
exit.

\item Fixed a bug in the \Condor{schedd} daemon that caused it to stop
negotiating for grid universe jobs in the case that it decided
it could not spawn any new \Condor{shadow} processes.

% Gnats PR 751
\item Added the ProcessId class (which more uniquely identifies a
process than a PID does) to the \Condor{dagman} abort duplicate
runs feature.  This makes it less likely that a given instance of
\Condor{dagman} will mistakenly conclude that another instance of
\Condor{dagman} is already running on the same DAG.  Also fixed an
unrelated bug in the abort duplicate runs feature that could cause
a \Condor{dagman} to not abort itself when it should.

\item Condor daemons leaked memory (consuming more and more memory over time)
when parsing ClassAds that use functions with arguments.

% Gnats PR 743
\item Fixed a bug in the \Condor{starter} daemon,
which caused it to look in the
wrong place for the job's executable, if \Attr{TransferExecutable} was set
to \Expr{True} in the job ClassAd.

\item \Condor{history} no longer crashes if \Attr{HISTORY} is not defined
in the Condor configuration file.

\item Fixed an unintentional change to the value of \Opt{-Condorlog}
in a \Condor{dagman} submit description file: it is once again the log file of
the first node job.

\item Fixed a bug in \Condor{q} that would cause \Condor{q} \Opt{-hold} or
\Condor{q} \Opt{-run} to exit with an error on some platforms.

\item Fixed a bug on Unix platforms, in which a misconfiguration of
\MacroNI{MAIL} would cause the \Condor{master} daemon to restart
all of its child
daemons whenever it tried (and failed) to send e-mail to the
administrator.

\item Network related error messages have been improved to make debugging
easier.  For example, when timing out on a read or write operation, the
peer's address is now included in the error message.

\item An invalid value for \MacroNI{UPDATE\_INTERVAL} now causes
the \Condor{startd} daemon to abort.  Previously, it would continue running,
but some invalid values (for example, 0) could cause it to stop sending
periodic ClassAd updates to the \Condor{collector}, even after being
reconfigured with a valid value.  Only a complete restart of
the \Condor{startd} daemon was sufficient to get it out of this state.

\item Fixed a bug that caused X.509 limited proxies to be delegated as 
impersonation (i.e. non-limited) proxies. Any authentication attempted
with the resulting proxies would fail.

\item Fixed a couple bugs that would cause Condor to lose track of
some Condor-related processes and subsequently fail to clean up (kill)
these processes.

\item Fixed a bug that would cause \Condor{history} to crash when
dealing with rotated history files. Note that history file rotation is
turned on by default. (See
Section~\ref{sec:Condor-wide-Config-File-Entries} for descriptions of
\Macro{ENABLE\_HISTORY\_ROTATION} and
\Macro{MAX\_HISTORY\_ROTATIONS}.)

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:
\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-6-8-1}Version 6.8.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item Version 6.8.1 fixes important bugs, some of which have
security implications.  All users are encouraged to upgrade, and full
disclosure of the vulnerabilities will be given at the end of October 2006.

\item Condor is now linked against GSI from Globus 4.0.2. This includes
a patch for Globus Security Advisories 2006-01 
(\URL{http://www.globus.org/mail\_archive/security-announce/2006/08/msg00000.html})
and 2006-02 
(\URL{http://www.globus.org/mail\_archive/security-announce/2006/08/msg00001.html}).
It also includes a
patch for the OpenSSL vulnerability detailed in CVE-2006-4339 and
\URL{http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv\_20060905.txt}.

\item The PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) library used by
Condor is now dynamically linked and shipped as a DLL with Condor for
Windows, rather than being statically linked.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

% Gnats PR 610
\item Added an optional argument to the \Condor{dagman} ABORT-DAG-ON
command that allows the DAGMan exit code to be specified separately
from the node value that causes the abort; also, a DAG can now be
aborted on a zero exit code from a node.

% I implemented in condor_rm.  Todd is handling condor_schedd implementation.
\item Added the \Macro{ALLOW\_FORCE\_RM} configuration variable.
If this expression evaluates to \Expr{True},
then an \Condor{rm} -f attempt is allowed.  If it evaluated to \Expr{False},
the attempt is disallowed.
The expression is evaluated in the context of the job ClassAd.
If not defined, the value defaults to \Expr{True}, matching the behavior of
previous Condor releases.

% Gnats PR 664
\item \Condor{dagman} will now reject DAGs for which any of the nodes'
user job log files are on NFS (because of the unreliability of NFS
file locking, this can cause DAGs to fail).  This feature can be
turned off by setting the \MacroNI{DAGMAN\_LOG\_ON\_NFS\_IS\_ERROR}
configuration macro to \Expr{False} (the default is \Expr{True}).

\item \Condor{submit} can now be configured to reject jobs for which
the log file is on NFS.
To do this, set the \MacroNI{LOG\_ON\_NFS\_IS\_ERROR}
configuration macro to \Expr{True}.
The default is that \condor{submit} will issue a warning
for a log file on NFS.

\item Added the \MacroNI{DAGMAN\_ABORT\_DUPLICATES} configuration macro,
which causes
\Condor{dagman} to attempt to detect at startup whether another
\Condor{dagman} is already running on the same DAG; if so, the second
\Condor{dagman} will abort itself.

\item The new configuration variable
\MacroNI{NETWORK\_MAX\_PENDING\_CONNECTS} may be used to limit the
maximum number of simultaneous network connection attempts.  This is
primarily relevant to the \Condor{schedd} daemon, which may try to connect to
large numbers of \Condor{startd} daemons when claiming them.
The \Condor{negotiator} may also
connect to large numbers of \Condor{startd} daemons when initiating
security sessions
used for sending MATCH messages.  On Unix, the default is to allow up to
eighty percent of the process file descriptor limit.  On Windows, the
default is 1600.

% Gnats 734/condor-admin 13872
\item Added some more debug output to \Condor{dagman} to clarify
fatal errors.

\item The -format argument to \Condor{q} and \Condor{status} can now take an expression in addition to a simple attribute name.

\item DRMAA is now available on most Linux platforms, Windows and PPC MacOS.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item When a large number of jobs (roughly 200 or more) are running from a
single \Condor{schedd} daemon, and those jobs are using job leases
(the default in 6.8), it is
possible for the \Condor{schedd} daemon to enter a state 
where it crashes on startup until all of
the job leases expire.
% The bug is more generic; it potentially hit any user of GenericQuery or
% CondorQuery, but we know of no users encountering the bug in any other cases.

\item Condor jobs submitted with the \AdAttr{NiceUser} priority were
  not being matched if the \Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_MATCHLIST\_CACHING}
  setting was TRUE (which is enabled by default).

\item Fixed a Quill bug that prevented it from running on Windows.  The
symptom showed with errors in the QuillLog such as
\begin{verbatim}
POLLING RESULT: ERROR
\end{verbatim}

\item Fixed a bug in Quill where it would cause errors such as
\begin{verbatim}
duplicate key violates unique constraint "history_vertical_pkey"
\end{verbatim}
in the QuillLog and the \Prog{PostgreSQL} log file.  These errors
triggered
a significant slowdown in the performance of Quill and the database.  This
would only happen when a job attribute changed type from a string
type to a numeric type, or vice versa.

%% This is the change to datathread.C
\item In those unusual cases where Condor is unable to create a new process,
it shuts down cleanly, eliminating a small possibility of data corruption.

\item Fixed a bug with the gt4 and nordugrid grid universe jobs that
caused the \File{stdout} and \File{stderr} of a job to not be 
transferred correctly, if the given file names had absolute paths.

% Gnats PR 711
\item \Condor{dagman} now echos warnings from \Condor{submit} and
\Stork{submit} to the \File{dagman.out} file.

\item Fixed a bug introduced in 6.7.20, causing the \Condor{ckpt\_server}
to exit immediately after starting up, unless Condor's security
negotiation was disabled.

% This was a bug because the default configuration file and manual
% both claimed it defaulted to 1MB.
\item \Macro{MAX\_<SUBSYS>\_LOG} defaults to one Megabyte, even if the
setting is missing from the configuration.  Previously it was 64 Kilobytes.

% this is the change to condor_secman.C by zmiller
\item Fixed a bug related to non-blocking connect that could occasionally
cause Condor daemons to crash.

% collector.C change: eliminated useless fprintf(stderr).
\item Fixed a rare bug where an exceptionally large query to the
\Condor{collector} could cause it to crash.  The most common cause was a single
\Condor{schedd} daemon restarting,
and trying to recover a large number of job leases at once.
More than approximately 250 running jobs on a single \Condor{schedd} daemon
would be necessary to trigger this bug.

\item When using the \Macro{JOB\_PROXY\_OVERRIDE\_FILE} configuration
parameter, the X.509 proxy will now be properly forwarded for Condor-C jobs.

\item Greatly reduced the chance that a Condor-C job in the REMOVED state
will be HELD due to an expired proxy or failure to talk to the remote
\Condor{schedd}.

\item Fixed error and debug messages added in Condor version 6.7.20 that
incorrectly reported IP and port numbers.  These messages were
intended to report the peer's address, but they were instead reporting the
local address of the network socket.

\item Fixed a bug introduced in Condor version 6.7.20
which could cause Condor daemons to
die with the message 
\begin{verbatim}
PANIC -- OUT OF FILE DESCRIPTORS
\end{verbatim}
The conditions
causing this related to failed attempts to send updated status
to the \Condor{collector} daemon,
with both non-blocking updates and security negotiation
enabled (the defaults).

\item Also fixed a bug in the negotiator with the same effect as
above, except it only happened with the configuration setting
\MacroNI{NEGOTIATOR\_USE\_NONBLOCKING\_STARTD\_CONTACT}=False.

\item Fixed a bug in \Condor{schedd} under Solaris that could also
cause file descriptors to become exhausted over time when many
machines were claimed in a short spans of time (e.g. over 100) and the
\Condor{schedd} process file descriptor limit was near 256.

\item Fixed a bug in \Condor{schedd} under Windows that could cause
network sockets to be allocated and never released back to the system.
The circumstances that could cause this were very rare.  The error
message in the logs indicating that this problem was happening is
\begin{verbatim}
ERROR: DuplicateHandle() failed in Sock::set_inheritable
\end{verbatim}
In cases where this error message is displayed, the network socket
is closed.

\item Under some conditions, when making TCP connections, Condor was
still trying to connect for the full duration of the operation timeout
(often 10 or 20 seconds), even if the connection attempt was refused
(for example, because the port being accessed is not accepting connections).
Now, the connect operation finishes immediately after the first such
failure, allowing the Condor process to continue with other tasks.

\item Fixed the problems relating to credential cache problems in the Kerberos
authentication mechanism.  The current version of Kerberos is 1.4.3.

% changes to condor_auth_ssl.C by zmiller
\item Fixed bugs in the SSL authentication mechanism that caused the
\Condor{schedd} to crash when submitting a job (on Unix) and caused
all tools and daemons to crash on Windows when using SSL.

\item Some of the binaries required to use Condor-C on Windows were
mistakenly not included in previous releases of Condor. This has been
fixed.

\item Fixed a problem on Windows where the \Condor{startd} could fail to
include some attributes in its ClassAd. This would result in some jobs
incorrectly not being matched to that machine.  This only happened if
\Macro{CREDD\_HOST} was defined and Condor daemons on the execute
machine were unable to authenticate with the \Condor{credd}.

\item Fixed a \Condor{dagman} bug which had prevented the
\MacroUNI{DAGManJobId} attribute from being expanded in job submit files
(for example,
when used as the value to define the \SubmitCmd{Priority} command).

\item Fixed a bug in \Condor{submit} that caused parallel universe jobs
submitted via Condor-C to become mpi universe jobs.

\item Fixed a bug which could cause Condor daemons to hang if they try
to write to the standard error stream (\File{stderr}) on some platforms.  In
general, this should never happen, but can, due to third party
libraries (beyond our control) trying to write error or other messages.

\item Fixed \Condor{status} to report error messages.

\item Fixed a bug in which setting the configuration variable 
\begin{verbatim}
NEGOTIATOR_CONSIDER_PREEMPTION = False
\end{verbatim}
caused an incorrect calculation.
The fraction of the pool already being claimed by a user was
calculated using the wrong total number of \Condor{startd} daemons.
This could cause some \Condor{startd} daemons to remain unclaimed,
even when there were jobs available to run on them.

% zmiller's changes to condor_io/condor_auth_fs.C
\item Fixed a security vulnerability in Condor's FS and FS\_REMOTE
authentication methods.  The vulnerability allowed an attacker to impersonate
another user on the system, potentially allowing submission of jobs as a
different user.  This may allow escalation to root privilege if the Condor
binaries and configuration files have improper permissions.  The fix is not
backwards compatible, which means all daemons and tools using FS authentication
must be running Condor 6.8.1 or greater.  The same applies to FS\_REMOTE; All
daemons and tools using FS\_REMOTE must be using Condor 6.8.1 or greater.  In
practice, this means that for FS, all Condor binaries on one host must be
version 6.8.1 or greater, but versions can be different from host to host.  For
FS\_REMOTE it means all binaries across all hosts must be 6.8.1 or greater.

% zmiller's changes to condor_credd/credd.C and stork/dap_server.C
\item Fixed a couple race conditions in stork and the credd where credential
files were possibly created with improper permissions before being set to owner
permissions.

\item Fixed a bug in the \Condor{gridmanager} that caused it to delegate
12-hour proxies for grid-type gt4 jobs and then not refresh them.

\item Fixed a bug in the \Condor{gridmanager} that caused a directory
needed for staging-in of grid-type gt4 job files to be removed when
the \Condor{Gridmanager} exited, causing the stage-in to fail.

% Condor-admin 14075
\item Fixed a bug that caused the \Term{checkpoint server} to restart
because of (ostensibly) getting an unexpected errno from select().

\item Fixed a bug on Windows where setting \SubmitCmd{output} or
\SubmitCmd{error} to a relative or absolute path (as opposed to a
simple file name without path information) would not work properly.

\item History file rotation did not previously work on Windows because
the name of a rotated files would contain an ISO 8601 extended format
timestamp, which contains colon characters. The naming convention for
rotated files has been modified to use ISO 8601 basic format, avoiding
this problem.

\item The CLAIMTOBE authentication method (which is inherently
insecure and should only be used for testing or other special
circumstances) previously would authenticate without providing the
``domain'' portion of the user name. As an example, a user would be
authenticated as simply ``user'' rather than
``user@cs.wisc.edu''. This problem has been fixed, but the new
protocol is not backwards compatible so the fix is turned off by
default. Correct behavior can be enabled by setting the
\Macro{SEC\_CLAIMTOBE\_INCLUDE\_DOMAIN} parameter to \Expr{True}.

\item Fixed a bug with the \MacroNI{NEGOTIATOR\_MATCHLIST\_CACHING} that
would cause very low-priority jobs (like jobs submitted with
\MacroNI{nice\_user=True}) to not match even if resources were available.

\item Fixed a buffer overflow that could crash the \Condor{negotiator}.

\item \MacroNI{SCHEDD\_ROUND\_ATTR\_<xxxx>} preserves the value being
rounded up when it is a multiple of the power of 10 specified for
rounding.  Previously, the value would be incremented; now it remains
the same.  For example, if SCHEDD\_ROUND\_ATTR\_<xxxx>=2 and the value
being rounded up is 100, it now remains 100, rather than being
incremented to 200.

\item Fixed \Condor{updates\_stats} to report it's version number
correctly.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \Opt{-completedsince} option to \Condor{history} works
when Quill is enabled.  The behavior of \Condor{history}
\Opt{-completedsince} is undefined when Quill is \emph{not}
enabled.

\end{itemize}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-6-8-0}Version 6.8.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item The default configuration for Condor now requires that
\Macro{HOSTALLOW\_WRITE} be explicitly set.  Condor will refuse
to start if the default configuration is used unmodified.
Existing installations should not need to change anything.  For
those who desire the earlier default, you can set it to "*", but
note that this is potentially a security hole allowing anyone to
submit jobs or machines to your pool.

\item Most Linux distributions are now supported using dynamically
  linked binaries built on a RedHat Enterprise Linux 3 machine.
  Recent security patches to a number of Linux distributions have
  rendered the binaries built on RedHat 9 machines ineffective.
  The download pages have been changed to reflect this, but Linux users
  should be aware of this change.
  The recommended download for most x86 Linux users is now:
  \File{condor-6.8.0-linux-x86-rhel3-dynamic.tar.gz}.

\item Some log messages have been clarified or moved to different
  debugging levels.
  For example, certain messages that looked like errors were printed
  to \MacroNI{D\_ALWAYS}, even though nothing was wrong and the system was
  behaving as expected.

\item The new features and bugs fixed in the rest of this section only
  refer to changes made since the 6.7.20 release, not the last stable
  release (6.6.11).
  For a complete list of changes since 6.6.11, read the 6.7 version
  history in section~\ref{sec:History-6-7} on
  page~\pageref{sec:History-6-7}. 

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Version 1.4 of the Condor DRMAA libraries are now included 
  with the Condor release.
  For more information about DRMAA, see section~\ref{API-DRMAA} on
  page~\pageref{API-DRMAA}.

\item Version 1.0.15 of the Condor GAHP is now used for Condor-G and
  Condor-C. 

% Gnats PR 710
\item Added the \Opt{-outfile\_dir} command-line argument to
\Condor{submit\_dag}.  This allows you to change the directory in which
\Condor{dagman} writes the \File{dagman.out} file.

\item Added a new \Opt{--summary} (also \Opt{-s}) option to the
\Condor{update\_stats} tool.  If enabled, this prevents it from
displaying the entire history for each machine and only displays the
summary info.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a number of potential static buffer overflows in various
  Condor daemons and libraries.

\item Fixed some small memory leaks in the \Condor{startd},
  \Condor{schedd}, and a potential leak that effected all Condor
  daemons.

\item Fixed a bug in Quill which caused it to crash when certain
long attributes appeared in a job ad.

\item The startd would crash after a reconfig if the address of a
collector had not been resolved since the previous reconfig
(e.g. because DNS was down during that time).

\item Once a Condor daemon failed to lookup the IP address of the
collector (e.g. because DNS was down), it would fail to contact the
collector from that time until the next reconfig.  Now, each time Condor
tries to contact the collector, it generates a fresh DNS query if the
previous attempt failed.

\item When using Condor-C or the -s or -r command-line options to
\condor{submit}, the job's standard output and error would be placed
in the job's initial working directory, even if the job ad said to
place them in a different directory.

% Gnats PRs 501 and 663
\item Greatly sped up the parsing of large DAGs (by a factor of 50
or so) by using a hash table instead of linear search to find DAG nodes.

% Gnats PR 697
\item Fixed a bug in \Condor{dagman} that caused an EXECUTABLE\_ERROR
event from a node job to abort the DAG instead of just marking the
relevant node as failed.

\item Fixed a bug in \Condor{collector} that caused it to discard
machine ads that don't have an IP address field (either StartdIpAddr
or STARTD\_IP\_ADDR).  The \Condor{startd} will always produce a
StartdIpAddr field, but machine ads published through
\Condor{advertise} may not.

\item When using \MacroNI{BIND\_ALL\_INTERFACES} on a dual-homed
machine, a bug introduced in 6.7.18 was causing Condor daemons to
sometimes incorrectly report their IP addresses, which could cause
jobs to fail to start running.

\item Made the event checking in \Condor{dagman} less strict: 
added the new "allow duplicate events" value to the
\MacroNI{DAGMAN\_ALLOW\_EVENTS} macro (this value is part of the
default); 16 value now also allows terminate event before submit;
changed "allow all events" to "allow almost all events"
(all except "run after terminal event"), so it is more useful.

% Gnats PR 712
\item \Condor{dagman} and \Condor{submit\_dag} now report
\Opt{-NoEventChecks} as ignored rather than deprecated.

\item Fixed a bug in the \Condor{dagman} \Opt{-maxidle} feature:
a shadow exception event now puts the corresponding job into the
idle state in \Condor{dagman}'s internal count.

\item Fixed a problem on Windows where daemons would sometimes crash
when dealing with UNC path names.

\item Fixed a problem where the \Condor{schedd} on Windows would
incorrectly reject a job if the client provided an \Attr{Owner}
attribute that was correct but differed in case from the authenticated
name.

\item Fixed a \Condor{startd} crash introduced in version 6.7.20. This
crash would appear if an execute machine was matched for preemption
but then not claimed in time by the appropriate \Condor{schedd}.

\item Resolved an issue where the \Condor{startd} was unable to clean
up jobs' execute directories on Windows when the \Condor{master} was
started from the command line rather than as a service.

\item Added more patches to Condor's DRMAA interface to make it more
compatible with Sun Grid Engine's DRMAA interface.

\item Removed the unused \MacroNI{D\_UPDOWN} debug level and added the
  \MacroNI{D\_CONFIG} debug level.

\item Fixed a bug that caused \Condor{q} with the \Opt{-l} or \Opt{-xml}
arguments to print out duplicate attributes when using Quill.

\item Fixed a bug that prevented Condor-C jobs (universe grid jobs of type condor)
from submitting correctly if \MacroNI{QUEUE\_ALL\_USERS\_TRUSTED} is set to
True.

\item Fixed a bug that could cause the \Condor{negotiator} to crash if the
pool contains several different versions of the \Condor{schedd} and in the
config file \MacroNI{NEGOTIATOR\_MATCHLIST\_CACHING} is set to True.

\item Changed the default value for config file entry
\MacroNI{NEGOTIATOR\_MATCHLIST\_CACHING} from False to True.  When set to
True, this will instruct the negotiator to safely cache data in order to
improve matchmaking performance.

\item The Condor{master} now recognizes \Condor{quill} as a valid
  Condor daemon without any manual configuration on the part of site
  administrators.
  This simplifies the configuration changes required to enable Quill. 

\item Fixed a rare bug in the \Condor{starter} where if there was a
  failure transferring job output files back to the submitting host,
  it could hang indefinitely, and the job appeared as if it was
  continuing to run.

\end{itemize}


\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \Opt{-completedsince} option to \Condor{history} works
when Quill is enabled.  The behavior of \Condor{history}
\Opt{-completedsince} is undefined when Quill is \emph{not}
enabled.

\end{itemize}
