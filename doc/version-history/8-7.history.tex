\section{\label{sec:History-8-5}Development Release Series 8.7}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of HTCondor.
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-7-2}Version 8.7.2}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.7.2 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.7.2 released on Month Date, 2017.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Improved the performance of the condor\_schedd by setting the
default for the knob SUBMIT\_SKIP\_FILECHECKS to false.  This prevents
the schedd from checking the readability of all input files, and skips
the creation of the output files on the submit side at submit time.
Output files are now created either at transfer time, when file transfer
is on, or by the job itself, if a shared filesystem is used.  As a result
of this change, it is possible that a job runs to completion, and only
then is put on hold because the output file on the submit machine cannot
by written to.
\Ticket{6220}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-7-1}Version 8.7.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.7.1 released on April 24, 2017.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Previously, when the number of forked children processing Collector
  queries surpassed the maximum set by the configuration knob \Macro{COLLECTOR\_QUERY\_WORKERS}, the
  Collector handled all new incoming queries in-processes (i.e. without
  forking). As processing a query and sending out the result to the network
  could take a long time, the result of servicing such queries in-process in
  the Collector is likely to drop a lot of updates. So now in v8.7.1, instead of
  servicing such queries in-process, they are queued up for servicing as soon as
  query worker child processes become available.  The configuration knob 
  \Macro{COLLECTOR\_QUERY\_WORKERS\_PENDING} was introduced; see
  section\~ref{param:CollectorQueryWorkersPending}.
\Ticket{6192}

\item Default value for \Macro{COLLECTOR\_QUERY\_WORKERS} changed from 2 to 4.
\Ticket{6192}

\item Introduced configuration macro
	\MacroNI{COLLECTOR\_QUERY\_WORKERS\_RESERVE\_FOR\_HIGH\_PRIO} so that the
	collector prioritizes queries that are important for the operation of the
	pool (such as queries from the negotiator) ahead of servicing user
	invocations of \Condor{status}.  
\Ticket{6192}

\item Introduced configuration macro \Macro{COLLECTOR\_QUERY\_MAX\_WORKTIME} to
	define the maximum amount of time the collector may service a query from a
	client like condor\_status.  See section\~ref{param:CollectorQueryMaxWorktime}.
\Ticket{6192}

\item Added several new statistics on collector query performance into the Collector
	ClassAd, including \AdAttr{ActiveQueryWorkers}, \AdAttr{ActiveQueryWokersPeak},
	\AdAttr{PendingQueries}, \AdAttr{PendingQueriesPeak}, \AdAttr{DroppedQueries},
	and \AdAttr{RecentDroppedQueries}.  See section\~ref{sec:Collector-ClassAd-Attributes}.
\Ticket{6192}

\item Further refinement and initial documentation of the HTCondor Annex.

\Ticket{6150}
\Ticket{6155}
\Ticket{6157}
\Ticket{6184}
\Ticket{6196}
\Ticket{6216}
\Ticket{6218}

\item Docker universe jobs can now use condor\_chirp command
(if it is in the image).
\Ticket{6162}

\item In the Job Router, when a candidate job matches multiple routes,
the first route is now always selected.
The old behavior of spreading jobs across all matching routes round-robin
style can be enabled by setting the new configuration parameter
\MacroNI{JOB\_ROUTER\_ROUND\_ROBIN\_SELECTION} to \Expr{True}.
\Ticket{6190}

\item The \Condor{schedd} now keeps a count of jobs by state for each owner and submitter
and will report them to \Condor{q}. Condor{q} will display these totals unless the new
configuration parameter \Macro{CONDOR\_Q\_SHOW\_OLD\_SUMMARY} is set to true. In 8.7.1
this parameter defaults to true.
\Ticket{6160}

\item Milestone 1 for late materialization in the \Condor{schedd} was completed. This milestone adds the
undocumented option \Opt{-factory} to \Condor{q} that can be used to submit a late materializing job cluster
to the \Condor{schedd}.  The \Condor{schedd} will refuse the submission unless the configuration parameter 
Macro{SCHEDD\_ALLOW\_LATE\_MATERIALIZATION} is set to true.
\Ticket{6212}

\item Increased the default value for configuration parameter
\MacroNI{NEGOTIATOR\_SOCKET\_CACHE\_SIZE} to 500.
\Ticket{6165}

\item Added new DaemonCore statistics UdpQueueDepth to measure the
number of bytes in the UDP receive queue for daemons with a UDP command port.
\Ticket{6183}

\item Improved speed of handling queries to the collector by caching the 
the configuration knob SHARED\_PORT\_ADDRESS\_REWRITING.
\Ticket{6187}

\item The \Condor{collector} on Linux now handles some queries in process and some
by forking a child process. This allows it to avoid the overhead of forking to handle
queries that will take little time. The policy for deciding which queries to handle in process
is controlled by a new configuration parameter \Macro{HANDLE\_QUERY\_IN\_PROC\_POLICY}.
\Ticket{6191}

\item Added \Opt{-limit} option to \Condor{status} and changed the \Condor{collector} to honor it.
\Ticket{6198}

\item \Condor{submit} was changed to use the same utility library that the submit python bindings use.
This should help insure that submit via python bindings will give the same results as using \Condor{submit}.
\Ticket{6181}.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-7-0}Version 8.7.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.7.0 released on March 2, 2017.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Optimized the code that reads reads ClassAds off the wire making the maximum possible update rate
for the Collector about 1.7 times higher than it was before.
\Ticket{6105}
\Ticket{6130}

\item New statistics have been added to the Collector ad to show time spent handling queries.
\Ticket{6123}

\item Changed the formatting of the printing of ClassAd expressions with
parentheses. Now there is no space character after every open parenthesis, or
before every close parenthesis
This looks more natural, is somewhat faster for the condor to parse, and
saves space.  That is, an expression that used to print like

\begin{verbatim}
( ( ( foo ) ) )
\end{verbatim}
now will print like this
\begin{verbatim}
(((foo)))
\end{verbatim}
\Ticket{6082}

\item Technology preview of the HTCondor Annex. The HTCondor Annex allows one
to extend their HTCondor pool into the cloud.
\URL{https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/wiki?p=HowToUseCondorAnnexWithOnDemandInstances}
\Ticket{6121}

\item Added \Opt{-annex} option to \Condor{status} and \Condor{off}.  Requires
an argument; the request is constrained to match machines whose
\Expr{AnnexName} ClassAd attribute matches the argument.
\Ticket{6116}
\Ticket{6117}

\item A refreshed X.509 proxy is now forwarded to the remote cluster
in Bosco.
\Ticket{5841}

\item Added several new statistics to the Negotiator ad, mainly
detailing how time is spent in the negotiation cycle.
\Ticket{6060}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Removed redundant updates to the job queue by the Job Router.
\Ticket{6102}

\end{itemize}
