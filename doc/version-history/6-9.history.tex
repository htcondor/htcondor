%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of Condor.
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-6-9-1}Version 6.9.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Improved the scalability of the algorithm used by 
the \Condor{schedd} daemon to find runnable jobs.
This makes a noticeable difference in \Condor{schedd} daemon performance,
when there are on the order of thousands of jobs in the queue.

\item the \Dflag{COMMAND} debugging level has been enhanced to
log many more messages. 

\item Updated the version of DRMAA, which contains several great
improvements regarding scalability and race conditions.

% Gnats PR 774
\item Added the DAGMAN\_SUBMIT\_DEPTH\_FIRST configuration macro which
causes \Condor{dagman} to submit ready nodes in more-or-less depth-first
order if set to \Expr{True}.  (The default behavior is to submit
the ready nodes in breadth-first order.)

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item \Condor{configure} used to always make a personal Condor with
\Opt{--install} even when \Opt{--type} called for only "execute" or
"submit" types.  Now, \Condor{configure} honors the \Opt{--type}
argument, even when using \Opt{--install}.
If \Opt{--type} is not specified, the default is to still install a
full personal Condor with the following daemons: Master, Collector,
Negotiator, Schedd, Startd. 

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\label{sec:New-6-9-0}Version 6.9.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item \Condor{chirp} command now supports writing messages to the userlog.

\item \Condor{chirp} getattr and putattr now send all classad getattr and putattr
commands to the proc 0 classad, which allows multiple proc parallel jobs to
use proc 0 as a scratchpad.

\item Parallel jobs now suport an AllRemoteHosts attribute, which lists all the
hosts across all procs in a cluster.

\item The DAGMAN\_ABORT\_DUPLICATES config macro (which causes
\Condor{dagman} to abort itself if it detects another \Condor{dagman}
running on the same DAG) now defaults to \Expr{True} instead of
\Expr{False}.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.
