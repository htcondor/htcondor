\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item \Condor{chirp} command now supports writing messages to the userlog.

\item \Condor{chirp} getattr and putattr now send all classad getattr and putattr
commands to the proc 0 classad, which allows multiple proc parallel jobs to
use proc 0 as a scratchpad.

\item Parallel jobs now suport an AllRemoteHosts attribute, which lists all the
hosts across all procs in a cluster.

\item The DAGMAN\_ABORT\_DUPLICATES config macro (which causes
\Condor{dagman} to abort itself if it detects another \Condor{dagman}
running on the same DAG) now defaults to \Expr{True} instead of
\Expr{False}.
