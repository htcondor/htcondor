\section{\label{sec:History-8-1}Development Release Series 8.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of HTCondor.
The details of each version are described below.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-1-4}Version 8.1.4}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.1.4 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.1.4 released on Month Date, 2013.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item The protocol between \Condor{q} and the schedd was rewritten.  The new
protocol does not require the schedd to fork a child process and does
not cause blocking; the result is that the schedd should be able to handle
many concurrent \Condor{q} requests with minimal resource usage.
\Ticket{4111}

\item The python bindings now can refresh a remote job's GSI proxy
 as a part of the \texttt{Schedd} object.
\Ticket{4116}

\item By default, the TCP keepalive interval is automatically tuned to 5
minutes.  This causes at least one packet to be sent on established but
idle TCP connections once every 5 minutes and speeds up the detection
of connections that were silently dropped by NAT or firewall devices.
Without this, the \Condor{shadow} may not reliably recover from transient
network failures.  This behavior is controlled by the new TCP\_KEEPALIVE\_INTERVAL
parameter; setting this to 0 restores the prior behavior.
The parameter CCB\_HEARTBEAT\_INTERVAL default has been reduced to 5 minutes.
\Ticket{4122}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor now interacts with EC2 services using POST instead of GET,
which permits more services to accept user data greater than 8KB.

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-1-3}Version 8.1.3}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.1.3 released on December 23, 2013.
This developer release contains all bug fixes from HTCondor version 8.0.5.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item The parsing of configuration has changed with respect to how
line continuation characters and comments interact.
The line continuation character no longer takes precedence over the
comment character.
\Ticket{4027}

\index{SUBSYS\_SUPER\_ADDRESS\_FILE macro@\texttt{<SUBSYS>\_SUPER\_ADDRESS\_FILE} macro}
\index{configuration macro!\texttt{SUBSYS\_SUPER\_ADDRESS\_FILE}}
\item When the super user issues a command 
or when the new \Condor{sos} tool invokes another tool,
the command can be serviced with a higher priority. 
This should be useful when attempting to get information from an
overloaded daemon, in order to diagnose or fix a problem.
Commands directed at the \Condor{schedd} or \Condor{collector} daemons 
have this ability by default.
Other DaemonCore daemons require configuration using the new 
configuration variable
\MacroB{<SUBSYS>\_SUPER\_ADDRESS\_FILE}.
\Ticket{4029}

\item The dedicated scheduler cpu usage within the \Condor{schedd} is now
throttled, so that it cannot consume all of the cpu, while starving the vanilla
scheduler.  This throttle can be adjusted by the new configuration variable
\Macro{DEDICATED\_SCHEDULER\_DELAY\_FACTOR}.  
This variable, which defaults to five,
sets the ratio of time spent not in the dedicated scheduler to the 
time scheduling parallel jobs.  
With this default of five, 
a maximum of 20\% of the scheduler's time will go to scheduling
parallel jobs.
\Ticket{4048}

\item The new \Condor{defrag} daemon ClassAd attribute 
\Attr{MeanDrainedArrived}
measures the mean time between arrivals of fully drained machines,
and the new attribute \Attr{DrainedMachines} 
measures the total numbers of fully drained machines
which have arrived during the run time of this \Condor{defrag} daemon.
\Ticket{4055}

\item The new \Opt{-defrag} option for \Condor{status} queries ClassAds
of the \Condor{defrag} daemon.
\Ticket{4039}

\item Machine ClassAd attributes \Attr{ExpectedMachineQuickDrainingCompletion}
and \Attr{ExpectedMachineGracefulDrainingCompletion} are updated with their
completion times if there are no active claims,
making these attributes more useful in setting policy for
partitionable slots. 
\Ticket{3481}

\item In a DAG, the node retry number is now available as VARS macro
(see section~\ref{dagman:VARS}).
\Ticket{4032}

\item Macro substitution both within configuration and within submit
description files has been extended to specify and use  
an optional default value if a value is not defined.
Section~\ref{sec:Config-File-Macros} has details for configuration.
\Ticket{4033}

\item The Python bindings \Code{htcondor} module has 
a new \Procedure{read\_events} method to acquire an iterator of
an HTCondor event log file.
\Ticket{4071}

\item The new \Opt{-daemons} option to \Condor{who} prints information
about the HTCondor daemons running on the specified machine,
including the daemon's PID, IP address and command port.
\Ticket{4007}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item Configuration variable \Macro{DAGMAN\_DEFAULT\_NODE\_LOG}
has been made more powerful,
so that it can be defined in HTCondor configuration files, 
instead of being useful only when defined in a per-DAG configuration file.
See section~\ref{param:DAGManDefaultNodeLog} for details.
\Ticket{3930}

\item The new configuration variable \Macro{CORE\_FILE\_NAME} is used to set
the name that DaemonCore uses to create a core file,
in the event of a daemon crash.
The default value for this configuration variable appends the daemon name,
so a crash of the \Condor{schedd} would create a core file named
\File{core.SCHEDD}.
\Ticket{4100}

\item The new configuration variable \Macro{JOB\_EXECDIR\_PERMISSIONS}
defines the permissions on a job's scratch directory. 
It defaults to setting permissions as \emph{0700}.
\Ticket{4016}

\item The following recently added machine ClassAd attributes have been renamed.
\begin{description}
\item \Attr{TotalJobStarts} became \Attr{JobStarts}.
\item \Attr{RecentTotalJobStarts} became \Attr{RecentJobStarts}.
\item \Attr{TotalPreemptions} became \Attr{JobPreemptions}.
\item \Attr{RecentPreemptions} became \Attr{RecentJobPreemptions}.
\item \Attr{TotalRankPreemptions} became \Attr{JobRankPreemptions}.
\item \Attr{RecentTotalRankPreemptions} became \Attr{RecentJobRankPreemptions}.
\item \Attr{TotalUserPrioPreemptions} became \Attr{JobUserPrioPreemptions}.
\item \Attr{RecentTotalUserPrioPreemptions} became \Attr{RecentJobUserPrioPreemptions}.
\end{description}
\Ticket{4101}

\item The new \Condor{schedd} statistics ClassAd attribute
\Attr{Autoclusters} gives the number of active autoclusters.
\Ticket{4020}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-1-2}Version 8.1.2}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.1.2 released on October 31, 2013.
This 8.1.2 release contains all bug fixes from HTCondor version 8.0.4.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item \Condor{config\_val} now supports \Opt{-dump} and \Opt{-verbose}
options to query configuration remotely from daemons.
\Ticket{3894}

\item The \Condor{chirp} protocol and command line tool has been
enhanced to support lower-cost, delayed updates to the job
ClassAd residing in the \Condor{schedd}; updates occur as other communications
take place, eliminating the overhead of a separate update.
These two new Chirp commands,
\Opt{set\_job\_attr\_delayed} and \Opt{get\_job\_attr\_delayed} allow the job
to send lightweight notification for events such as progress
monitoring, which need not be durable.
\Ticket{3353}

\item \Condor{history} has been enhanced to support
remote history using new \Opt{-pool} and \Opt{-name} options.
\Ticket{3897}

\item Matchmaking in the \Condor{negotiator} may be made aware of resources
available for partitionable slots.
This permits multiple jobs to be matched against a partitionable slot
during a single negotiation cycle.
The new policies discussed in Section~\ref{sec:consumption-policy}
are set using new configuration variables and are known as consumption policies.
\Ticket{3435}

\item Definition syntax for the authorization configuration variables
\Macro{ALLOW\_*} and \Macro{DENY\_*} has been expanded to permit
the specification of Unix netgroups.
See section~\ref{sec:Security-Authorization} for the syntax.
\Ticket{3859}

\item Definition syntax for the configuration variable
\Macro{QUEUE\_SUPER\_USERS} has been expanded to accept a specification
of Unix user groups.
See section~\ref{param:QueueSuperUsers} for the syntax.
\Ticket{3859}

\item To ensure that a grid universe job running at an EC2 service
terminates, 
HTCondor now checks after a fixed time interval 
that the job actually has terminated,
instead of relying on the service's potentially unreliable 
job shut down indication.
If the job has not terminated after a total of four checks,
the job is placed on hold; it does not leave the queue marked as completed.
\Ticket{3438}

\item Email alerts about file transfers taking longer than
\Macro{MAX\_TRANSFER\_QUEUE\_AGE} are now grouped together
to reduce the number of email messages that are sent.

\item Floating point values in Old ClassAds are now printed in a more
human-readable format, while retaining 64-bit double precision.
In previous versions, these values were always printed in scientific
notation.
\Ticket{3928}

\item \Condor{ssh\_to\_job} now works with grid universe jobs
which use EC2 resources.
\Ticket{1548}

\item Machine ClassAd attributes \Attr{Disk} and \Attr{TotalDisk} 
are now published as 64-bit integers,
rather than being capped at the maximum value of a 32-bit integer.
\Ticket{1784}

\item In an effort to improve scalability under heavy load, the tuning
configuration variable \Macro{MAX\_REAPS\_PER\_CYCLE} is exposed,
as defined at section~\ref{param:MaxReapsPerCycle}.
The default for this variable changed from 1 to 0.
\Ticket{3992}

\item To reduce the overwhelming quantity of per-user \Condor{schedd} 
statistics that are generated when configuration variables 
\MacroNI{SCHEDD\_COLLECT\_STATS\_FOR\_<Name>} or 
\MacroNI{SCHEDD\_COLLECT\_STATS\_BY\_<Name>} are used, 
the statistics are now published at verbosity level 2,
instead of verbosity level 1.
\Ticket{3980}

\item The Python bindings now include the \Code{Negotiator} class to
manage users and their priorities.
\Ticket{3893}

\item The Python bindings now provide automatic conversions from 
dictionaries to ClassAds,
so they can accept a dictionary directly as an argument,
rather than constructing a ClassAd from the dictionary.
\Ticket{3892}

\item The Python bindings \Code{ClassAd} module has 
\Procedure{quote} and \Procedure{unquote} 
methods to help create string literals. 
\Ticket{3900}

\item The Python bindings \Code{ClassAd} module has new
methods \Procedure{parseAds} and \Procedure{parseOldAds} 
that implement an iterator over ClassAds, in the New ClassAd and 
Old ClassAd format. 
\Ticket{3918}

\item The ordering of adding attributes to the machine ClassAd has been
changed, such that the attributes \Attr{Draining}, \Attr{DrainingRequestId},
and \Attr{LastDrainStartTime} are now added before the job retirement
is calculated.
This allows a decision about preemption to be made based on if
a machine is currently draining. 
\Ticket{3901}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item When \Macro{USE\_PID\_NAMESPACES} is \Expr{True}, 
the soft kill signal is now successfully sent to the job.
Previously, a \Condor{rm}
command of such a job would not remove the job until the
killing timeout had expired.
\Ticket{3981}

\item If a standard universe job exited without producing any
checkpoints and no checkpoint server was used, 
two spurious error messages would be logged to the \File{SchedLog},
as it tried to remove the old checkpoint images from the
non-existent checkpoint server.  
These error messages are no longer logged.
\Ticket{3919}

\item When configuration variable \Macro{STARTER\_RLIMIT\_AS} is set 
to its default value of 0, it means that there is no limit.  
This value was logged as a limit of 0Mb, leading to confusion.
Now, no message is logged in this default case.
\Ticket{3914}

\item Improved how the \Condor{schedd} notifies the \Condor{shadow}
and \Condor{gridmanager} about modifications to job ClassAds made using
\Condor{qedit}.
\Ticket{3909}

\item Grid universe jobs now use the correct executable file when
\SubmitCmd{copy\_to\_spool} is set to \Expr{True}.
Previously, the executable file named in the submit description file 
would be copied to the remote server, 
rather than the copy of the executable file stored in the spool directory.
\Ticket{3589}

\item The example configuration provided within files 
\File{condor\_config.generic} and \File{condor\_config.generic.redhat} 
has been updated to fix an inadequate expression defining 
\MacroNI{NEGOTIATOR\_POST\_JOB\_RANK} when the \Condor{startd} is 
configured to not run benchmarks, as \Attr{Kflops} would not be defined.
\Ticket{3589}

\item Fixed a Python binding crash due to a segmentation fault,
when evaluating an expression tree with an undefined reference.
The fix allows the user to define the \Code{ClassAd} scope 
within which an expression tree is evaluated.
\Ticket{3910}

\item The Python bindings now include a correct conversion of
\Code{absTime} and \Code{relTime} ClassAd literals to the 
corresponding Python types.
\Ticket{3911}

\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-1-1}Version 8.1.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.1.1 released on September 17, 2013.
This release contains all bug fixes from the stable release version 8.0.2.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Reduced the number of calls to the service when managing EC2 jobs. This
should increase the number of EC2 jobs HTCondor can manage on a given service
without overloading it.
\Ticket{3683}

\item When configuration variable \Macro{USE\_SHARED\_PORT} is \Expr{True},
\Macro{SHARED\_PORT} will now be automatically added to \Macro{DAEMON\_LIST}.
To disable this new behavior, set the new configuration variable:
\begin{verbatim}
  AUTO_INSERT_SHARED_PORT_IN_DAEMON_LIST = False
\end{verbatim}
\Ticket{3799}

\item Floating point values in ClassAds are now printed as 64-bit
double precision values when sent over the network, written to disk, and
displayed using the \Opt{-long} or \Opt{-autoformat} options of
\Condor{status} and \Condor{q}.
\Ticket{3363}

\item In the Pegasus/DAGMan workflow metrics,
as documented in section ~\ref{sec:DAGMetrics},
the two metrics
\Expr{dagman\_id} and \Expr{parent\_dagman\_id} are now reported
as the \Attr{ClusterId} of the \Condor{dagman} job.  This
eliminates any privacy concerns with reporting the \Condor{schedd} 
daemon's address,
which includes the submit machine's IP address.

\item The python bindings now can perform the equivalent of 
\Condor{ping} as a part of the \texttt{SecMan} object.
\Ticket{3857}

\item The \Condor{gridmanager} and \Condor{ft-gahp} now create
dynamic security session for performing file transfers.
Previously, the security configuration had to be set in a special
way for file transfers with the \Condor{ft-gahp} to work.
\Ticket{3536}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item The new configuration variable \Macro{USE\_RESOURCE\_REQUEST\_COUNTS}
is a boolean value that defaults to \Expr{True}, 
reducing the latency of negotiation 
when there are many jobs next to each other in the queue 
with the same auto cluster, and many matches are being made.
\Ticket{3585}

\item Four new machine ClassAd attributes are advertised.
\Attr{TotalJobStarts} is the total number of jobs started by 
this \Condor{startd} daemon since it booted. 
\Attr{RecentTotalJobStarts} is the number of jobs started in the
last twenty minutes.  
Similarly, \Attr{TotalPreemptions} is
the number of jobs preempted since the \Condor{startd} daemon started,
and \Attr{RecentTotalPreemptions} is 
the number in the last 20 minutes.
\Ticket{3712}

\item \Macro{FILE\_TRANSFER\_DISK\_LOAD\_THROTTLE} now accepts tabs in addition to spaces as delimiters.
\Ticket{3798}

\item Configuration variable \Macro{VALID\_SPOOL\_FILES} has been expanded
to accept a single asterisk wild card character in each listed file name.
\Ticket{3764}

\item The new configuration variable \Macro{GAHP\_DEBUG\_HIDE\_SENSITIVE\_DATA}
is a boolean value that defaults to hiding sensitive data 
such as security keys and passwords
when communication with a GAHP server is written to a daemon log.
\Ticket{3536}

\item The default value of configuration variable 
\Macro{ENABLE\_CLASSAD\_CACHING} has changed to \Expr{True} for all
daemons other than the \Condor{shadow}, \Condor{starter}, and \Condor{master}.
\Ticket{3441}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \Condor{gridmanager} now does proper failure recovery when
submitting EC2 grid universe jobs to services that do not support 
the EC2 ClientToken parameter.
Previously, if there was a failure when submitting jobs to OpenStack
or Eucalyptus, the jobs could be submitted twice.
\Ticket{3682}

\item Fixed the printing of nested ClassAds, so that the nested ClassAds
can be read back properly.
\Ticket{3772}

\item Fixed a bug between the \Condor{gridmanager} and \Condor{ft-gahp}
that caused file transfers to fail if one of the two daemons was older
than version 8.1.0.
\Ticket{3856}

\item Fixed a bug that caused substitution in configuration variable
evaluation to ignore per-daemon overrides. 
This is a long standing bug that may result in subtle changes
to the way your configuration files are processed.
An example of how substitution works with the per-daemon overrides
is in section \ref{sec:Config-File-Macros}.
\Ticket{3822}

\item Fixed a bug that caused the command
\begin{verbatim}
  condor_submit -
\end{verbatim}
to be interpreted as an interactive submit,
rather than a request to read input from \File{stdin}.
\Condor{qsub} was also modified to be immune to this bug,
such that it will still work with other versions of HTCondor containing
the bug.
\Ticket{3902}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}
\item DAGMan recovery mode does not work for Pegasus-generated SUBDAGs.
For SUBDAGs, doing \Condor{hold} or \Condor{release} on
the \Condor{dagman} job, or stopping and re-starting the
\Condor{schedd} with the DAGMan
job in the queue will result in failure of the DAG.  This can be
avoided by doing a \Condor{rm} of the DAGMan job, which produces a Rescue
DAG, and re-submitting the DAG; the Rescue DAG is automatically run.
This bug was introduced in HTCondor version 8.0.1, and it also appears
in versions 8.0.2, 8.1.0, and 8.1.1.
\Ticket{3882}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-1-0}Version 8.1.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.1.0 released on August 5, 2013.
This release contains all bug fixes from the stable release version 8.0.1.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Added support for publishing information about an HTCondor pool 
to \TM{Ganglia}.
See section~\ref{sec:Config-gangliad} on 
page~\pageref{sec:Config-gangliad} for configuration variable details.
\Ticket{3515}

\item Improved the performance of the \Condor{collector} daemon when running
at sites that do not observe daylight savings time.
\Ticket{2898}

\item \Condor{q}, \Condor{rm}, \Condor{status} and \Condor{qedit} are now 
more consistent in the way they handle the \Opt{-constraint} option.
\Ticket{1156}

\item The new \Condor{dagman\_metrics\_reporter} executable
with manual page at ~\pageref{man-condor-dagman-metrics-reporter},
reports metrics for DAGMan workflows running under Pegasus.  \Condor{dagman}
now generates an output file of the relevant metrics,
as described at ~\pageref{sec:DAGMetrics}.
\Ticket{3532}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item The default value of configuration variable
\Macro{COLLECTOR\_MAX\_FILE\_DESCRIPTORS} has changed to 10240,
and the default value of configuration variable 
\Macro{SCHEDD\_MAX\_FILE\_DESCRIPTORS} has changed to 4096.
This increases the scalability of the default configuration.
\Ticket{3626}

\item The new configuration variable
\Macro{FILE\_TRANSFER\_DISK\_LOAD\_THROTTLE} enables dynamic
adjustment of the level of file transfer concurrency in order to
keep the disk load generated by transfers below a specified level.
Supporting this new feature are configuration variables
\Macro{FILE\_TRANSFER\_DISK\_LOAD\_THROTTLE\_WAIT\_BETWEEN\_INCREMENTS},
\Macro{FILE\_TRANSFER\_DISK\_LOAD\_THROTTLE\_SHORT\_HORIZON}, and
\Macro{FILE\_TRANSFER\_DISK\_LOAD\_THROTTLE\_LONG\_HORIZON}.
\Ticket{3613}

\item The following new \Condor{schedd} ClassAd attributes are for
monitoring file transfer activity:
\AdAttr{TransferQueueMBWaitingToDownload},
\AdAttr{TransferQueueMBWaitingToUpload},
\AdAttr{FileTransferDiskThrottleLevel},
\AdAttr{FileTransferDiskThrottleHigh}, and
\AdAttr{FileTransferDiskThrottleLow}.
\Ticket{3613}

\item The default value for the configuration variable
\Macro{PASSWD\_CACHE\_REFRESH} has been changed from 300 seconds to
72000 seconds (20 hours).
\Ticket{3723}

\item The new configuration variables
\Macro{DAGMAN\_PEGASUS\_REPORT\_METRICS} and
\Macro{DAGMAN\_PEGASUS\_REPORT\_TIMEOUT}
set defaults used by the new \Condor{dagman\_metrics\_reporter} executable,
which reports metrics for DAGMan jobs running under Pegasus.
\Ticket{3532}
\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.0.0 had an unintended change in the Chirp 
wire protocol.
This change caused \Condor{chirp} with the \Opt{put} option
to fail when the execute node
was running HTCondor version 7.8.x or earlier versions. 
HTCondor 8.0.1 and later
versions will now send the original wire protocol, and accept either the
original protocol, or the variant that HTCondor version 8.0.0 sends.
\Ticket{3735}

\item Fixed a bug that could cause the daemons to crash on Unix platforms,
if the operating system reported that a job owner's account 
did not exist, for example due to a temporary NIS or LDAP failure.
\Ticket{3723}

\item Fixed a bug that resulted in a misleading error message when
\Condor{status} with the \Opt{-constraint} option specified a constraint 
that could not be parsed.
\Ticket{1319}

\item Fixed a typo in the output of \Condor{q},
where a period was erroneously present within a heading.
\Ticket{3703}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.
