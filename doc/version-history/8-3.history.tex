\section{\label{sec:History-8-3}Development Release Series 8.3}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of HTCondor.
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-3-1}Version 8.3.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.3.1 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.3.1 released on Month Date, 2014.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Added a configuration parameter, \Macro{COLLECTOR\_PORT}, which specifies
the default port used by the \Condor{collector} daemon and command line tools.
The default value is 9618 - the same port used in previous releases.
\Ticket{4432}

\item The \Condor{shared\_port} daemon is now enabled by default on new installs on
non-Windows platforms.
With this change, all HTCondor daemons will share port 9618 for all incoming TCP
connections, greatly simplifying firewall configuration.  Only users of HTCondor-G
submitting to Globus GRAM endpoints will need additional incoming TCP ports in
the firewall.

\emph{Note} that this causes all HTCondor hosts to use TCP port 9618 by default,
differing from previous behavior (previously, only the collector host used a 
fixed port).  To restore the prior behavior, set \Macro{SHARED\_PORT\_PORT} to \Expr{0}.
\Ticket{3813}

The \Condor{shared\_port} daemon will now work if \Macro{DAEMON\_SOCKET\_DIR} is
longer than 100 characters in length.
\Ticket{4465}

\item The user-specific configuration file \Expr{~/.condor/condor\_config} will
now override the global configuration, instead of the other way around.  This
makes the user-specific configuration files more useful.
\Ticket{3158}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-3-0}Version 8.3.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.3.0 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.3.0 released on Month Date, 2014.
This release contains all improvements and bug fixes from 
HTCondor version 8.2.2.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item The job ClassAd attribute \Attr{DAG\_Status} is included in 
the \File{dagman.out} file.
\Ticket{4381}

\item When a daemon creates a child daemon process, it also creates a
security session shared with the child daemon.
This makes the initial communication between the daemons more efficient.
\Ticket{4405}

\item Added a \Opt{-DoRecovery} command-line flag to \Condor{dagman}
and \Condor{submit\_dag} that causes \Condor{dagman} to run in
recovery mode (see ~\ref{man-condor-submit-dag}).
\Ticket{2218}

\item The synchronization of the job event log was improved by only
using \Procedure{fsync} where necessary and 
\Procedure{fdatasync} where sufficient.  
This should provide a small reduction in disk I/O to 
the \Condor{schedd} daemon.
\Ticket{4283}

\item HTCondor can now internally cache the result of Globus authorization
callouts.  
The caching behavior is enabled by setting configuration variable
\Macro{GSS\_ASSIST\_GRIDMAP\_CACHE\_EXPIRATION} to a non-zero value.
This feature will be useful for sites that use the Globus authorization
callouts based only on DN and VOMS FQAN, and for sites that have 
performance issues.
\Ticket{4138}

\item The new \Opt{-ads} option to \Condor{status} permits a set of ClassAds
to be read from a file, processing the ClassAds as if they came from
the \Condor{collector}.
\Ticket{4414}

\item Daemon ClassAd hooks implementing Startd Cron functionality  
can now return multiple ClassAds,
and the hooks can specify which ClassAds their output should merge into.
\Ticket{4398}

\item Two new \Condor{schedd} ClassAd statistics attributes are
available: \Attr{JobsRunning} and \Attr{JobsAccumExceptionalBadputTime}.
\Ticket{4409}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug that caused \Condor{dagman} to unnecessarily attempt
to read node job submit description files, 
which could cause spurious warnings when in recovery mode.
Strictly speaking, the bug is fixed only for the
default case in which \MacroNI{DAGMAN\_ALWAYS\_USE\_NODE\_LOG} is set
to \Expr{True}.
\Ticket{3843}

\item Fixed a bug in the \Condor{schedd} daemon that caused the values
of the ClassAd attributes \Attr{JobsRunningSizes} and 
\Attr{ JobsRunningRuntimes} to be much larger than they should have been.
\Ticket{4409}

\end{itemize}
