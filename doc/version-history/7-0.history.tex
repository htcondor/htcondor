\section{\label{sec:History-7-0}Stable Release Series 7.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is a stable release series of Condor.
It is based on the 6.9 development series.
All new features added or bugs fixed in the 6.9 series are available
in the 7.0 series.
As usual, only bug fixes (and potentially, ports to new platforms)
will be provided in future 7.0.x releases.
New features will be added in the 7.1.x development series.

The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-7-0-0}Version 7.0.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item PVM support has been dropped.

\item The time zone for the \Prog{PostgreSQL} 8.2 database
  used with Quill on Windows machines must be explicitly set
  to use an abbreviation.
  This Windows environment variable is \verb@TZ@.
  Proper abbreviations for the value of this variable may be found
  within the \Prog{PostgreSQL} installation in a file,
  \File{share/timezonesets/<continent>.txt}, where
  \verb@<continent>@ is replaced by the continent of the 
  desired time zone.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item The Windows MSI installer now supports VM Universe.

\item Eliminated the ``tarball in a tarball'' in our distribution.
  The contents of \File{release.tar} from the distribution tarball
  (for example, \File{condor-6.9.6-linux-x86-centos45-dynamic.tar.gz}) is now
  included in the distribution tarball.

\item Updated \Condor{configure} to match the above change.  The
  \Opt{--install} option now takes a directory path as its parameter,
  for example \Opt{--install=/path/to/release}.
  It previously took the path to
  the \File{release.tar} tarball.

\item Added \Condor{install}, which is a symlink to \Condor{configure}.
  Invoking 
\begin{verbatim}
    condor_install
\end{verbatim}
  is identical to running
\begin{verbatim}
    condor_configure --install=.
\end{verbatim}

\item Added the option \Opt{--prefix=dir} to \Condor{configure} and
  \Condor{install}.  This is an alias for \Opt{--install-dir=dir}.

\item Added the option \Opt{--backup} option to \Condor{configure} and
  \Condor{install}.  This option renames the target \File{sbin} directory,
  if the \Condor{master} daemon exits while in the target \File{sbin} directory.
  Previous versions of \Condor{configure} did this by default.

\item Changed the default behavior of \Condor{install} to exit with a
  warning if the target \File{sbin} directory exists,
  the \Condor{master} daemon is in the \File{sbin} directory,
  and neither the \Opt{--backup} nor \Opt{--overwrite} options are specified.
  This prevents \Condor{install} from improperly moving an \File{sbin}
  directory out of the way.
  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
    condor_install --prefix=/usr
\end{verbatim}
  will not move \File{/usr/sbin} out of the way unless
  the \Opt{--backup} option is also specified.

\item Updated the usage summary of \Condor{configure} and
  \Condor{install} to be much more readable.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a memory leak in the \Condor{procd} daemon on Windows.

\item Fixed a problem that could cause Condor daemons to crash if a
  failure occurred when communicating with the \Condor{procd}.

\item Fixed a couple of problems that were preventing the
  \Condor{startd} from properly removing per-job directories
  when running with PrivSep.

\item The \Condor{startd} will no longer fail to initialize, 
  claiming the \MacroNI{EXECUTE} directory has improper permissions,
  when PrivSep is enabled.

\item Lookups of ClassAd attribute \Attr{CurrentTime} are now
  case-insensitive, just like all other attributes.

\item Fixed problems causing the following error message in the log file:

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
ERROR: receiving new UDP message but found a short message still waiting to be closed (consumed=1). Closing it now.
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\item The existence of the executable given in the submit file is now 
  enforced (when transferring the executable and not using VM 
  universe).

\item The copy of \Condor{dagman} that ships with Condor is now automatically 
  added to the list of trusted programs in the Windows Firewall.

\item Removed \SubmitCmd{remove\_kill\_sig} from the submission file
  generated by \Condor{submit\_dag} on Windows.

\item With large numbers of machine ClassAds (for example: 10,000), 
  an algorithm in \Condor{negotiator} was causing long delays at the 
  beginning of each negotiation cycle.

\item Use of \MacroNI{MAX\_CONCURRENT\_UPLOADS} was resulting in a
  connection attempt from \Condor{shadow} to \Condor{schedd} with a
  fixed 10 second timeout, which is sometimes too small.  This timeout
  has been increased to be the same as other connection timeouts between
  \Condor{shadow} and \Condor{schedd}, and it now respects
  \MacroNI{SHADOW\_TIMEOUT\_MULTIPLIER}, so it can be adjusted if necessary.

\item Fixed a bug in the \Condor{schedd} that could cause it to crash due
  to file descriptor exhaustion when trying to send messages to hundreds of
  \Condor{startd}s simultaneously.

\item Fixed a 6.9.4 bug in the \Condor{startd} that would cause it to crash
  when a BOINC backfill job exited.

\item Since 6.9.4, when using glExec, configuring \MacroNI{SLOTx\_EXECUTE}
  would cause \Condor{starter} to fail when starting the job.

\item Fixed a bug from 6.9.5 which caused authentication failure for
  the pool password authentication method.

\item Fixed a bug that caused Condor daemons to crash when encountering
  some types of invalid ClassAd expressions.

\item Fixed a bug under Linux that could cause multi-process daemons
  lacking a log lock file to crash while rotating logs that have reached
  their maximum configured size.

\item Fixed a bug under Windows that sometimes caused connection attempts
  between Condor daemons to fail with Windows error number 10056.

\item Fixed a problem in which there are multiple collectors in a pool
  for fault tolerance.  If the primary collector failed, the
  \Condor{negotiator} would fail over to the secondary collector
  indefinitely (or until the secondary collector also failed or the
  administrator ran \Condor{reconfig}).  This was a problem for users
  flocking jobs to the pool, because flocking currently only works with
  the primary collector.  Now, the \Condor{negotiator} will fail over
  for a restricted amount of time, up to
  \MacroNI{DEAD\_COLLECTOR\_MAX\_AVOIDANCE\_TIME} seconds.  The default
  is one hour, but if querying the dead primary collector takes very little
  time to fail, the negotiator may retry more frequently in order to remain
  responsive to flocked users.

\item Fixed a problem preventing the use of \Condor{q} \Opt{-analyze}
  with the \Opt{-pool} option.

\item Fixed a problem in the negotiator in which machines go
  unassigned when user priorities result in the machines getting split
  into shares that are rounded down to 0.  For example if there are 10
  machines and 100 equal priority submitters, then each submitter was
  getting 0.1 machines, which got rounded down to 0, so no machines were
  assigned to anybody.  The message in the negotiator log in this case
  was this:

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
Over submitter resource limit (0) ... only consider startd ranks
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\item Fixed a problem introduced in 6.9.3 that would cause daemons to
  run out of file descriptors if they create sub-processes and are
  configured to use a lock file for the debug log.

\item Standard universe jobs now work properly when using PrivSep.

\item Fixed problem with PrivSep mode where a job that dumps core would
  not get the core file transferred back to the the submit host if the
  \SubmitCmd{transfer\_output\_files} submit option were used.

\item Fixed a bug that caused the \Condor{starter} to crash if a job
called \Condor{chirp} with the \Expr{get\_job\_attr} option.
