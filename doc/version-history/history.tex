\section{\label{sec:History-Intro}Introduction to HTCondor Versions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This chapter provides descriptions of what features have been added or
bugs fixed for each version of HTCondor.
The first section describes the HTCondor version numbering scheme, what
the numbers mean, and what the different \Term{release series} are.
The rest of the sections each describe a specific release series, and
all the HTCondor versions found in that series.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Version-Number-Scheme}
HTCondor Version Number Scheme}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Starting with version 6.0.1, HTCondor adopted a new, hopefully easy to
understand version numbering scheme.
It reflects the fact that HTCondor is both a production system and a
research project.
The numbering scheme was primarily taken from the Linux kernel's
version numbering, so if you are familiar with that, it should seem
quite natural.

There will usually be two HTCondor versions available at any given time,
the \Term{stable} version, and the \Term{development} version.
Gone are the days of ``patch level 3'', ``beta2'', or any other random
words in the version string.
All versions of HTCondor now have exactly three numbers, separated by
``.''   

\begin{itemize}

\item The first number represents the major version number, and will
change very infrequently.

\item \emph{The thing that determines whether a version of HTCondor is
\Term{stable} or \Term{development} is the second digit.
Even numbers represent stable versions, while odd numbers represent
development versions.}

\item The final digit represents the minor version number, which
defines a particular version in a given release series.

\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Stable-Series}The Stable Release Series}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

People expecting the stable, production HTCondor system should download
the stable version, denoted with an even number in the second digit of
the version string.
Most people are encouraged to use this version.  
We will only offer our paid support for versions of HTCondor from the
stable release series.

\emph{On the stable series, new minor version releases will only
be made for bug fixes and to support new platforms.}
No new features will be added to the stable series.
People are encouraged to install new stable versions of HTCondor when
they appear, since they probably fix bugs you care about.
Hopefully, there will not be many minor version releases for any given
stable series.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Developement-Series}
The Development Release Series}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Only people who are interested in the latest research, new features
that haven't been fully tested, etc, should download the development
version, denoted with an odd number in the second digit of the version
string.  
We will make a best effort to ensure that the development series will
work, but we make no guarantees.

On the development series, new minor version releases will probably
happen frequently.
People should not feel compelled to install new minor versions unless
they know they want features or bug fixes from the newer development
version.

\emph{Most sites will probably never want to install a development
version of HTCondor for any reason.}
Only if you know what you are doing (and like pain), or were
explicitly instructed to do so by someone on the HTCondor Team, should
you install a development version at your site.

After the feature set of the development series is satisfactory to the
HTCondor Team, we will put a code freeze in place, and from that point
forward, only bug fixes will be made to that development series.
When we have fully tested this version, we will release a new stable
series, resetting the minor version number, and start work on a new
development release from there.
