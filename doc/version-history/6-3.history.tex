\section{\label{sec:History-6-3}Development Release Series 6.3}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the second development release series of Condor.

It contains numerous enhancements over the 6.2 stable series.
For example:

\begin{itemize}

\item 
Condor DAGMan is dramatically more reliable and efficient, and offers
a number of new features.

\end{itemize}

The 6.3 series has many other improvements over the 6.2 series, and
may be available on newer platforms.  The new features, bugs fixed,
and known bugs of each version are described below in detail.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:New-6-3-1}Version 6.3.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent New Features:
\begin{itemize}

\item
Added support for an \AdAttr{x509proxy} option in \Condor{submit}. There is 
now a seperate \Condor{GridManager} for each user and proxy pair. This will
be detailed in a future release of Condor.
 
\item
More Condor DAGMan improvements and bug fixes:

\begin{itemize}

\item 
Added a \oArgnm{-dag} flag to \Condor{q} to more succinctly display dags
and their ownership.

\item
Added a new event to the Condor userlog at the completion of a POST
script.  This allows DAGMan, during recovery, to know which POST
scripts have finished succesfully, so it no longer has to re-run them
all to make sure.

\item
Implemented separate \Arg{-MaxPre} and \Arg{-MaxPost} options to limit
the number of simultaneously running PRE and POST scripts.  The
\Arg{-MaxScripts} option is still available, and is equivalent to
setting both \Arg{-MaxPre} and \Arg{-MaxPost} to the same value.

\item
Added support for a new ``Retry'' parameter in the DAG file, which
instructs DAGMan to automatically retry a node a configurable number
of times if its PRE Script, Job, or POST Script fail for any reason.

\item
Added timestamps to all DAGMan log messages.

\item
Fixed a bug whereby DAGMan would clean up its lock file without
creating a rescue file when killed with SIGTERM.

\item
DAGMan no longer aborts the DAG if it encounters executable error or
job aborted events in the userlog, but rather marks the corresponding
DAG nodes as ``failed'' so the rest of the DAG can continue.

\item
Fixed a bug whereby DAGMan could crash if it saw userlog events for
jobs it didn't submit.

\end{itemize}

\item Added port restriction capabilities to Condor so you can specify a range
of ports to use for the communication between Condor Daemons.

\item To improve performance: if there's no \Macro{HISTORY} file
specified, don't connect back to the schedd to report your exit info on
successful compeletion, since the schedd is simply going to discard that
info anyway.

\item Added the macro \Macro{SECONDARY\_COLLECTOR\_LIST} to tell the
master to send classads to an additional list of collectors so you can
do administration commands when the primary collector is down.

\item When a job checkpoints it askes the shadow whether or not it
should and if so where. This fixes some flocking bugs and increases
performance of the pool.

\item Added match rejection diagnostics in \Condor{q} \oArgnm{-analyze} to
give more information on why a particular job hasn't started up yet.

\item Added \oArgnm{--vms} argument to \Condor{glidein} that enables the
control of how many virtual machines to start up on the target platform.

\item Added capability to the config file language to retrieve environment
variables while being processed.

\item Added capability to make default user user priority factor configurable
with the \Macro{DEFAULT\_PRIORITY\_FACTOR} macro in the config files.

\item Added full support for RedHat 7.1 and the gcc 2.96 compiler. However,
the standard universe binaries must still be statically linked.

\item When jobs are suspended or unsuspended, an event is now written into
the user job log.

\item Added \oArgnm{-a} flag to \Condor{submit} to add/override attributes
specified in the submit file.

\item Under Unix, added the ability for a submittor of a job to describe when
and how a job is allowed/not allowed to leave the queue. For example, if
a job has only run for 5 minutes, but it was supposed to have run an hour 
minimum, then do not let the job leave the queue but restart it instead.

\item New environment variable available CONDOR\_SCRATCH\_DIR available
in a standard or vanilla job's environment that denotes temporary space
the job can use that will be cleaned up automatically when the job leaves
from the machine.

\item Not exactly a new feature, but some internal parts of Condor had been
fixed up to try and improve the memory footprint of a few of our daemons.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:
\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug where \Condor{q} would produce wildly inaccurate run time
reports of jobs in the queue.

\item Fixed it so that if the condor scheduler fails to notify the
administrator through email, just print a warning and do not except.

\item Fixed a bug where \Condor{submit} would incorrectly create the user
log file.

\item Fixed a bug where a job queue sorted by date with \Condor{q} would
be displayed in descending instead of ascending order.

\item Fixed and improved error handling when \Condor{submit} fails.

\item Numerous fixes in the Condor User Log System.

\item Fixed a bug where when Condor inspects its on disk job queue log,
it would do it with case sensitivity. Now there is no case sensitivity.

\item Fixed a bug in \Condor{glidein} where it have trouble figuring out
the architecture of a minimally installed HP-UX machine.

\item Fixed it so that email to the user has the word ``condor'' capitalized
in the subject.

\item Fixed a situation where when a user has multiple schedulers submitting
to the same pool, the Negotiator would starve some of the schedulers.

\item Added a feature whereby if a transfer of an executable
from a submission machine to an execute machine fails, Condor
will retry a configurable numbers of times denotated by the
\Macro{EXEC\_TRANSFER\_ATTEMPTS} macro. This macro defaults to three if
left undefined. This macro exists only for the Unix port of Condor.

\item Fixed a bug where if a schedd had too many rejected clusters during a
match phase, it would ``except'' and have to be restarted by the master.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:
\begin{itemize}
\item The HP-UX Vendor C++ CFront compiler does not work with \Condor{compile}
if exception handling is enabled with +eh.

\item The HP-UX Vendor aCC compiler does not work at all with Condor.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\label{sec:New-6-3-0}Version 6.3.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent
Many Condor DAGMan improvements and bug fixes:

\begin{itemize}

\item
PRE and POST scripts now run asynchronously, rather than synchronously
as in the past.  As a result, DAGMan now supports a \Arg{-MaxScripts}
option to limit the number of simultaneously running PRE and POST
scripts.

\item
Whether or not POST scripts are always executed after failed jobs is
now configurable with the \Arg{-NoPostFail} argument.

\item
Added a \Arg{-r} flag to \Condor{submit\_dag} to submit DAGMan to a
remote \Condor{schedd}.

\item
Made the arguments to \Condor{submit\_dag} case-insensitive.

\item
Fixed a variety of bugs in DAGMan's event handling, so DAGMan should
no longer hang indefinitely after failed jobs, or mistake one job's
userlog events for those of another.

\item
DAGMan's error handling and logging output have been substantially
clarified and improved.  For example, DAGMan now prints a list of
failed jobs when it exits, rather than just saying ``some jobs
failed''.

\item
Jobs submitted by a \Condor{dagman} job now have \AdAttr{DAGManJobId}
and \AdAttr{DAGNodeName} in the job classad.

\item
Fixed a \Condor{submit\_dag} bug preventing the submission of DAGMan
Rescue files.

\item
Improved the handling of userlog errors (less crashing, more coping).

\item
Fixed a bug when recovering from the userlog after a crash or reboot.

\item
Fixed bugs in the handling of \Arg{-MaxJobs}.

\item
Added a \Arg{-a line} argument to \Condor{submit} to add a line to the
submit file before processing (overriding the submit file).

\item
Added a \Arg{-dag} flag to \Condor{q} to format and sort DAG jobs
sensibly under their DAGMan master job.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item \Condor{kbdd} doesn't work properly under Compaq Tru64 5.1, and
as a result, resources may not leave the ``Unclaimed'' state
regardless of keyboard or pty activity.  Compaq Tru64 5.0a and earlier
do work properly.

\end{itemize}
