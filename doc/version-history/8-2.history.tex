%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-2-0}Version 8.2.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.2.0 released on June 24, 2014.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item The new configuration variable \Macro{SOCKET\_LISTEN\_BACKLOG}
controls the listen backlog setting for a daemon's command port.
The default value of 500 implements the previously hard coded value.
\Ticket{4393}

\item Streamlined the network protocol used by \Condor{submit},
resulting in faster job submission times and less \Condor{schedd} overhead, 
especially when performing a submit to a remote \Condor{schedd}.
\Ticket{3846}

\item The default value for configuration variable \Macro{CLAIM\_WORKLIFE} 
has changed from 60 minutes to 20 minutes.
\Ticket{4374}

\item The default value for configuration variable 
\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_PRE\_JOB\_RANK} has changed to prefer to match
multi-core jobs to dynamic slots in a best-fit manner.
And, the default value for configuration variable
\Macro{PREEMPTION\_RANK} has changed to first choose the user with the
worst priority, and then choose the job of that user with the least
amount of accumulated run time. 
\Ticket {4374}

\item The default set of metrics published by the \Condor{gangliad} has been
reduced to an essential set of scheduler and negotiator metrics.
Also, the units for accumulated times have changed from seconds to hours.
\Ticket{4299}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug that caused a memory leak in the \Condor{procd}
when cgroup tracking is enabled.
\Ticket{4408}

\item Fixed a bug that caused a memory leak in the \Condor{collector}
under heavy load.  This bug was introduced in HTCondor version 8.1.5.
\Ticket{4370}

\item Windows machines with more than nine dynamic slots may have
failed to start jobs due to a limit on the number of characters
in a user name.
To address this limit, the user name is shortened from
\Expr{condor-reuse-slot<N>} to \Expr{condor-slot<N>}.
\Ticket{4388}

\item Fixed a bug in which \Condor{q} failed to communicate with a
\Condor{schedd} of HTCondor version 8.1.4.
\Ticket{4384}

\item Fixed bugs introduced in HTCondor version 8.1.5 that caused communication
between the \Prog{cream\_gahp} and the remote CREAM servers to fail.
\Ticket{4392}

\item Fixed a bug introduced in HTCondor version 8.1.2 that caused grid-type
cream jobs to fail when \SubmitCmd{copy\_to\_spool} was set to \Expr{True}
in the submit description file.
\Ticket{4391}

\item When submitting a grid universe job with a grid type of batch and
setting \SubmitCmd{request\_memory}, the job would fail if the remote
batch system was HTCondor. This has been fixed.
\Ticket{4367}

\item Improved the detection of IPv4 link-local addresses.
\Ticket{4341}

\item Fixed a bug in which the HTCondor central manager may attempt to
send email to a user named \Expr{NONE}, if configuration variable
\MacroNI{CONDOR\_DEVELOPERS} is left unset.
\Ticket{4399}

\item Fixed a bug in which \Condor{user\_prio} could result in a
segmentation fault when given the \Opt{-grouporder} option.
\Ticket{4407}

\item Fixed a bug that caused frequent crashes of the \Prog{cream\_gahp}.
\Ticket{4406}

\item Fixed a bug that prevented attribute \AdAttr{SubmitterUserPrio} from
	properly functioning in \MacroNI{PREEMPTION\_REQUIREMENTS} and 
	\MacroNI{PREEMPTION\_RANK} expressions as documented in
	section~\ref{sec:Priorities-in-Negotiation-and-Preemption}.
\Ticket{4369}

\item Fixed a bug that could cause some commands sent to HTCondor daemons
to fail, especially when sent over a slow network.
This bug was introduced in HTCondor version 8.1.5.
\Ticket{4368}

\end{itemize}
