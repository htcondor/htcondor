\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.2.3 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.2.3 released on Month Date, 2014.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a rare memory leak. The leak occurred when IPv6 was disabled, but the NETWORK\_INTERFACE and COLLECTOR\_HOST were set to IPv6 addresses.
\Ticket{4502}

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-2-2}Version 8.2.2}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.2.2 released on August 7, 2014.

\item This version of HTCondor includes a full port for 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.0 on the x86\_64 architecture.
A full port includes support for the standard universe.
\Ticket{4511}

\item The RPM for RHEL 7 contains several subpackages for elements of HTCondor,
modernizing the RPM-based installation.
\Ticket{4518}

\end{itemize}

\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item When using the Windows installer,
the choice of a new pool caused an invalid value in the configuration of 
\Expr{\$\$(FULL\_HOSTNAME)} to be used, 
instead of the correct value of \Expr{\$(FULL\_HOSTNAME)}.
This prevented all daemons from talking to the \Condor{collector} daemon.
\Ticket{4509}

\item Fixed a bug that only manifested on Linux 3.14 or more recent kernels, 
which caused the \Condor{collector} to respond very slowly to queries.
\Ticket{4489}

\item Fixed a Windows platform bug that caused \Condor{status} to abort
when \Macro{ENABLE\_CLASSAD\_CACHING} was set to \Expr{True}. 
\Ticket{4459}

\item Fixed a bug that prevented the detection of hyper-threaded cores
on Linux platforms.
All cores reported as full cores without hyper-threading. 
\Ticket{4458}

\item Fixed the detection of hyper-threaded cores on Mac OS X platforms.
\Ticket{4516}

\item Fixed a Windows platform bug that caused the \Condor{starter}
to abort while creating the job sandbox.
The bug presents as a minor memory leak in all versions of HTCondor 
for Windows prior to version 8.2.2 and 8.3.0.
In HTCondor version 8.2.0, this bug could sometimes
present as an abrupt \Condor{starter} exit with status -1073740940. 
\Ticket{4467}

\item Fixed a file descriptor leak in the \Condor{shared\_port}
daemon.
\Ticket{4456}

\item Fixed a bug existing on Linux platforms with newer kernels.
With cgroups enabled, the OOM killer killed the job when the job
went over its memory allocation.  
Now, the \Condor{starter} catches the OOM signal and 
places the job on hold with an appropriate message.
\Ticket{4435}

\item Fixed a bug in which the expression set by submit command 
\SubmitCmd{periodic\_remove} would not remove
jobs running on Linux machines when PID namespaces were enabled.
\Ticket{4421}

\item Fixed a Windows-specific bug:  specifying a DAG node status file
caused DAGMan to fail.
\Ticket{4361}

\item Fixed a problem in which job rank may not have always worked
as documented due to a bug in HTCondor's auto cluster mechanism.
\Ticket{4403}

\item Updated the HTCondor DRMAA library to version 1.6.2. 
This version fixes minor bugs in the functions for querying how a job exited.
\Ticket{4413}

\item \Condor{submit} no longer fails if the value of
\SubmitCmd{x509userproxy} is a relative path, 
and the value of \SubmitCmd{initialdir} is set to a directory 
that is not the current working directory of \Condor{submit}.
\Ticket{4415}

\item Fixed a bug that caused \Condor{submit\_dag} to core dump if
a non-existent DAG file was specified.
\Ticket{4423}

\item Fixed a bug that resulted in output of the string \AdStr{undefined}, 
instead of printing nothing,
when using the \Opt{\%s} format specifier to
\Condor{q} \Opt{-format}.
\Ticket{4418}

\item Fixed a bug in the \Condor{shadow} that caused the user's supplemental
groups to be unset when trying to write to the user's job event log.
This could result in the job being held with the hold reason
\Expr{"Failed to initialize user log to <path>"}.
\Ticket{4437}

\item Fixed a bug in the \Prog{cream\_gahp} that would corrupt memory when
using more than the default number of worker threads.
\Ticket{4416}

\item Fixed a bug that could cause the \Prog{cream\_gahp} to fail at
start up, because it could not locate a Globus threading library.
\Ticket{4440}

\item When a daemon checks whether a user has execute permission for a
directory, it now considers supplemental groups and POSIX ACLs in the
determination.
\Ticket{4402}

\item Fixed a bug that could cause GSI security operations to fail if
\Env{GLOBUS\_THREAD\_MODEL} was set in the environment.
\Ticket{4464}

\item Fixed a bug in \Condor{ft-gahp} that caused it to ignore the peer
version given by the \Expr{CONDOR\_VERSION} command, causing it to think that
its file transfer peer was the same version as itself.
\Ticket{4473}

\item Fixed the handling of optional authentication parameters given to
\Prog{remote\_gahp}. This is used as part of the batch grid-type when
submitting jobs to a remote system via \Prog{ssh}.
\Ticket{4434}

\item  Fixed a bug in the parsing the value set for the
\Attr{Detected<Tag>} attribute of the output of a script specified by
configuration variable \Macro{MACHINE\_RESOURCE\_INVENTORY\_<TAG>}.
If the value of \Attr{Detected<Tag>} was not a string, 
then it would not be parsed correctly. 
As a result the resource quantity would be set to 0.
\Ticket{4427}

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-2-0}Version 8.2.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.2.0 released on June 24, 2014.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item The new configuration variable \Macro{SOCKET\_LISTEN\_BACKLOG}
controls the listen backlog setting for a daemon's command port.
The default value of 500 implements the previously hard coded value.
\Ticket{4393}

\item Streamlined the network protocol used by \Condor{submit},
resulting in faster job submission times and less \Condor{schedd} overhead, 
especially when performing a submit to a remote \Condor{schedd}.
\Ticket{3846}

\item The default value for configuration variable \Macro{CLAIM\_WORKLIFE} 
has changed from 60 minutes to 20 minutes.
\Ticket{4374}

\item The default value for configuration variable 
\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_PRE\_JOB\_RANK} has changed to prefer to match
multi-core jobs to dynamic slots in a best-fit manner.
And, the default value for configuration variable
\Macro{PREEMPTION\_RANK} has changed to first choose the user with the
worst priority, and then choose the job of that user with the least
amount of accumulated run time. 
\Ticket {4374}

\item The default set of metrics published by the \Condor{gangliad} has been
reduced to an essential set of scheduler and negotiator metrics.
Also, the units for accumulated times have changed from seconds to hours.
\Ticket{4299}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug that caused a memory leak in the \Condor{procd}
when cgroup tracking is enabled.
\Ticket{4408}

\item Fixed a bug that caused a memory leak in the \Condor{collector}
under heavy load.  This bug was introduced in HTCondor version 8.1.5.
\Ticket{4370}

\item Windows machines with more than nine dynamic slots may have
failed to start jobs due to a limit on the number of characters
in a user name.
To address this limit, the user name is shortened from
\Expr{condor-reuse-slot<N>} to \Expr{condor-slot<N>}.
\Ticket{4388}

\item Fixed a bug in which \Condor{q} failed to communicate with a
\Condor{schedd} of HTCondor version 8.1.4.
\Ticket{4384}

\item Fixed bugs introduced in HTCondor version 8.1.5 that caused communication
between the \Prog{cream\_gahp} and the remote CREAM servers to fail.
\Ticket{4392}

\item Fixed a bug introduced in HTCondor version 8.1.2 that caused grid-type
cream jobs to fail when \SubmitCmd{copy\_to\_spool} was set to \Expr{True}
in the submit description file.
\Ticket{4391}

\item When submitting a grid universe job with a grid type of batch and
setting \SubmitCmd{request\_memory}, the job would fail if the remote
batch system was HTCondor. This has been fixed.
\Ticket{4367}

\item Improved the detection of IPv4 link-local addresses.
\Ticket{4341}

\item Fixed a bug in which the HTCondor central manager may attempt to
send email to a user named \Expr{NONE}, if configuration variable
\MacroNI{CONDOR\_DEVELOPERS} is left unset.
\Ticket{4399}

\item Fixed a bug in which \Condor{user\_prio} could result in a
segmentation fault when given the \Opt{-grouporder} option.
\Ticket{4407}

\item Fixed a bug that caused frequent crashes of the \Prog{cream\_gahp}.
\Ticket{4406}

\item Fixed a bug that prevented attribute \AdAttr{SubmitterUserPrio} from
	properly functioning in \MacroNI{PREEMPTION\_REQUIREMENTS} and 
	\MacroNI{PREEMPTION\_RANK} expressions as documented in
	section~\ref{sec:Priorities-in-Negotiation-and-Preemption}.
\Ticket{4369}

\item Fixed a bug that could cause some commands sent to HTCondor daemons
to fail, especially when sent over a slow network.
This bug was introduced in HTCondor version 8.1.5.
\Ticket{4368}

\end{itemize}
