\section{\label{sec:History-8-5}Development Release Series 8.5}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of HTCondor.
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-5-7}Version 8.5.7}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.5.7 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.5.7 released on Month Date, 2016.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \Condor{negotiator} by default no longer cross advertises the
user prio and resources in use from every slot in a machine ad to every
other slot in that machine ad.  \Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_CROSS\_SLOT\_PRIOS} = true
re-enables the old behaviour.  The accounting information for the current
user of the slot remains advertised.
\Ticket{5785}

\item Simplified the DAG node priority algorithm:  the "effective" priority
of a node is now simply the sum of the explicit node priority and the
overall DAG priority.  (See section ~\ref{sec:DAG-SetNodePriority} for
more details.)
sec:DAG-SetNodePriority
\Ticket{5749}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-5-6}Version 8.5.6}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.5.6 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.5.6 released on Month Date, 2016.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Allow the second argument of the classad ternary operator (expr ? value1 : value2)
to be ommitted.  This new syntax means:  evaluate the expr, and if it evaluated to
a defined value or error, return it.  If undefined, return value2.
\Ticket{5782}

\item The default output of \Condor{q} is now the \Opt{-batch} output. To change
the default back to its pre 8.5.6 value, set the new configuration variable
 \Macro{CONDOR\_Q\_DASH\_BATCH\_IS\_DEFAULT} to false.
\Ticket{5708}

\item Fixed a bug in Docker universe that required the name
of a transfered executable to begin with "./"
\Ticket{5761}

\item The value of the configuration parameter 
\Macro{DOCKER\_DROP\_ALL\_CAPABILITIES} is now no longer just
true or false, but a classad expression evaluated in the context
of the machine (my) and the job (target).
\Ticket{5759}

\item When running Docker Universe containers on docker version 1.11
and newer, HTCondor now also sets --no-new-privs, to prevent
setuid and setgid programs from running in containers, unless
\Macro{DOCKER\_DROP\_ALL\_CAPABILITIES} evaluated to false.
\Ticket{5680}

\item The hostname of the container that Docker Universe jobs
run in is now set to a more useful name.  Instead of a hash, it
now contains the job's owner, the cluster and proc of the job,
and the hostname of the machine the container runs on.
\Ticket{5760}

\item Fixed a bug the prevented Docker universe jobs from reporting
their network usage correctly.
\Ticket{5750}

\item ClassAds can now be represented in JSON format.
\condor{q}, \condor{status}, and \condor{history} have a \Arg{-json}
command line option, which causes their output to be printed in JSON.
\Ticket{5688}

\item Job ads now include \Attr{NumJobCompletions}, which counts the
number of times a job exited of its own accord (successfully or not) and
then successfully completed file transfer (if any was requested).
\Ticket{5705}

\item The high-availability and replication daemons may now use shared port.
\Ticket{5726}

\item Monitoring the status of PBS and SLURM jobs is now much more efficient.
Now, one query to the batch system is done for all jobs, instead of a
separate query for each job.
\Ticket{5722}

\item \Condor{dagman} now allows commands to be more flexibly ordered
within a DAG file.  (See section~\ref{dagman:command order} for details.)
\Ticket{5732}

\item Any \SubmitCmd{accounting\_group} and
\SubmitCmd{accounting\_group\_user} values specified for a
DAG are now propagated to all jobs of the workflow, including sub-DAGs.
\Ticket{5077}

\item Added several statistics about commands issued to the GAHP server
to the grid ads that the \Condor{gridmanager} sends to the \Condor{collector}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item GahpCommandsIssued
  \item GahpCommandsTimedOut
  \item GahpCommandsInFlight
  \item GahpCommandsQueued
  \item GahpCommandRuntime
  \end{itemize}
\Ticket{5698}

\item Kerberos authentication is now non-blocking, allowing an HTCondor
daemon authenticating clients with Kerberos to handle more simultaneous
incoming connections.
\Ticket{5737}

\item Simplified how job leases are handled for grid universe jobs.
Now, all jobs going to the same remote resource share a single lease
time.
\Ticket{5625}

\item The \Condor{shadow}, \Condor{starter} and \Condor{c-gahp} daemons
now log TCP statistics for file transfers.  See ~\ref{dflag:stats} for
more details.
\Ticket{5663}

\item A new configuration variable \Macro{MAX\_RUNNING\_SCHEDULER\_JOBS\_PER\_OWNER}
can be used to limit the number of DAGs that any single user can have running at
a time.
\Ticket{5568}

\item The full path to the submit file is now available as an automatic
submit variable.
\Ticket{5677}

\item New options have been added to \Condor{history}, so that \Condor{history} can be used as the
the \Macro{HISTORY\_HELPER} for remote \Condor{history}. The options are:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \Opt{-since} Scanning of the history file stops when an expression becomes true or a job id is read.
  \item \Opt{-completedsince} Scanning of the history file stops when a job completed earlier than this time is read.
  \item \Opt{-scanlimit} Used by remote \Condor{history} to limit the number of jobs read from the history file.
  \item \Opt{-attributes} Used by remote \Condor{history} to limit the attributes transferred back.
  \item \Opt{-inherit} Used by remote \Condor{history} to define the socket to write results to.
  \item \Opt{-stream-results} Used by remote \Condor{history} so that results can be printed as they arrive.
  \end{itemize}
\Ticket{5642}

\item Condor{history} will default to doing a remote query if there is a \Macro{SCHEDD\_HOST} configured. This behavior
can be defeated by passing the new \Opt{-local} argument.
\Ticket{5765}

\item The ability to send \Condor{drain} commands is now exposed
through the Python bindings.
See section~\ref{Python-OtherModule} for details.
\Ticket{5507}

\item A new class -- the Submit class -- was added to the Python
bindings. It allows for the submission of HTCondor jobs via the
Python bindings using the same keywords and automatic behavior as
\Condor{submit}.
See section~\ref{Python-OtherModule} for details.
\Ticket{5666}

\item Configuration files now support the declaration of multiline values, the is primarily of use when
configuring the \Condor{job\_router}.
\Ticket{5721}

\item A new function \Code{userMap()} has been added to the ClassAd language
to facilitate the mapping of users to groups in the \Condor{schedd} and
\Condor{job\_router} (see ~\ref{sec:classadFunctions} for details).
\Ticket{5751}

\item Configuration file metaknobs can now take arguments and pass them
on the the metaknob to be expanded.
\Ticket{5739}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed bugs preventing HTCondor daemons from recognizing an address in
Sinful format as its own when operating in mixed (IPv4 and IPv6) mode.  One
manifestation of this would be errors from the HAD daemon when specifying
hosts by name in the \MacroNI{HAD\_LIST} or \MacroNI{REPLICATION\_LIST}.
\Ticket{5728}
\Ticket{5776}

\item \Condor{user\_prio} now more correctly shows information
about submitters flocking to a pool, but who haven't used 
any resources.
\Ticket{5743}

\item \Condor{who} now reports docker universe jobs more completely.
\Ticket{5740}

\item No longer leak a file in the user's home directory each time a
job is submitted to SLURM.
\Ticket{5742}

\item Fix a bug that prevented HTCondor from removing jobs from SLURM.
\Ticket{5804}

\item Fixed a bug when attempting to authenticate using multiple
methods wherein if a method failed, the remaining methods were not
always attempted.
\Ticket{5673}

\item Fixed a bug that prevented the \condor{schedd} from reading the
job's X.509 proxy file when writing information to the
\MacroNI{SCHEDD\_AUDIT\_LOG}.
\Ticket{5770}

\item Fixed a bug in \Condor{q} where the SIZE column would not grow as needed to fit the data.
\Ticket{5667}

\item Fixed a bug where the \Condor{schedd} did not treat a user as a queue superuser when it
should have if the configuration included a map file, which is common for GSI authentication.
\Ticket{5530}

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-5-5}Version 8.5.5}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.5.5 released on June 6, 2016.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Improved the performance of the \Condor{negotiator} when running
with a large number of users or groups.  The accounting data is only
written to disk when it changes, not unconditionally.
\Ticket{5719}

\item The EC2 GAHP now rate-limits its requests, and responds to overload
warnings with an exponential back-off.  Additionally, fewer operations are
now performed on a per-job basis (as few as one in some cases).  The
resulting scalability improvements have been demonstrated to permit a single
GAHP to manage ten thousand instances.  Because the overload condition is
account- and region- specific, the grid manager now launches a GAHP for
each account-region pair.  We therefore recommend adding \Expr{D\_PID} to
\MacroNI{EC2\_GAHP\_DEBUG}, for disambiguation, and this is now the default.
\Ticket{5561}
\Ticket{5588}
\Ticket{5620}

\item The grid manager now assigns \Attr{HoldReasonCode}s and
\Attr{HoldReasonSubCode}s to EC2 jobs when they go on hold.  Values are
subject to change until the stable release.
\Ticket{5628}

\item The grid manager now advertises some metrics from the EC2 GAHP.
\Ticket{5580}

\item Some Linux distributions for supercomputer compute nodes and
others distributions for docker images have no /var/run/utmp. HTCondor no longer
aborts when this file is missing, when it tries to determine keyboard
idle times, it just assumes these kinds of machines have no keyboards.
\Ticket{5624}

\item Docker Universe jobs now correctly advertise \Macro{RemoteUserCpu}
and \Macro{RemoteSysCpu} in their job ad and in the job log file.
\Ticket{5609}

\item A batch name specified for a DAG (with the \Condor{submit\_dag}
\Opt{-batch-name} option) is now propagated to all jobs of that DAG,
including sub-DAGs.
\Ticket{5493}

\item The batch name for a \Condor{dagman} job (if not set) now
defaults to \Arg{DagFile}+\Arg{cluster} (where \Arg{DagFile}
is the primary DAG file of the \Condor{dagman} job, and \Arg{cluster}
is the HTCondor cluster of the \Condor{dagman} job).
Because the batch name is now propagated throughout a workflow, if
no batch name is specified, the batch name for all jobs in the
workflow will be \Arg{DagFile}+\Arg{cluster} of the top-level
\Condor{dagman} job.
\Ticket{5605}

\item The files named in the submit file attributes \SubmitCmdNI{vm\_disk},
\SubmitCmdNI{xen\_kernel}, and \SubmitCmdNI{xen\_initrd} now refer to
locations on the execute machine.
\Condor{submit} no longer modifies these values or checks for their
existence on the submit machine.
If these files need to be transferred by HTCondor, then they should be
listed in \SubmitCmdNI{transfer\_input\_files} and their presence in
these vm universe attributes shouldn't include any path information.
\Ticket{4167}

\item In the python bindings, an \texttt{ExprTree} can be cast to an integer
or floating point value.
\Ticket{5636}

\item HTCondor now supports the following systemd features: Socket Activation,
Watchdog, Status message, and journald logging. In these release, the
Socket Activation is not configured, because the security system is not
prepared to properly handle the socket passed in from outside HTCondor.
\Ticket{4144}

\item Added config knob \MacroNI{DEFAULT\_MASTER\_SHUTDOWN\_SCRIPT} to
specify a default program to exec as root upon \Condor{master} exit.
See Section~\ref{param:DefaultMasterShutdownScript} for details.
\Ticket{5590}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug that caused file transfers to fail when using Bosco.
\Ticket{5704}

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-5-4}Version 8.5.4}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.5.4 released on May 2, 2016.

\item The \SubmitCmdNI{deltacloud} type in the grid universe, which allowed
submission to Deltacloud services, has been removed.
\Ticket{5569}

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item \Condor{status} can now display the utilization of a \Condor{startd} with
a single line of output for each machine rather than a line per slot.
In this release this output is enabled by passing \Opt{-compact} to \Condor{status}
but in a future release this will be the default output of \Condor{status}.
\Ticket{5596}

\item Improved the performance of the \Condor{collector} by
not computing dropped update statistics, statistics which 
have never been accessible by users.
\Ticket{5566}

\item The performance of the \Condor{history} tool has been
significantly improved.
\Ticket{5536}

\item \Condor{user\_prio} now queries the \Condor{collector} for 
accounting information by default, when appropriate.  This should be
much faster than the older way of querying the \Condor{negotiator}. The
old path is still available by passing the -negotiator option to the
tool.
\Ticket{5508}.

\item The default value of \MacroNI{DAGMAN\_ALWAYS\_RUN\_POST} has been
changed from \Expr{True} to \Expr{False}.  This means that, by
default, if the PRE script of a DAG node fails, the POST script
of the node will \emph{not} be run.  (This had been the default
behavior until version 7.7.2.  The 7.7.2-8.5.3 behavior can be
restored by setting \MacroNI{DAGMAN\_ALWAYS\_RUN\_POST} to 
\Expr{True}, or by passing the new \Opt{-AlwaysRunPost}
argument to \Condor{submit\_dag}.)
\Ticket{5477}

\item The \Prog{batch\_gahp} can now submit multi-core jobs to HTCondor.
\Ticket{5638}

\item The \Prog{batch\_gahp}'s ability to generate a limited X.509 proxy
for use by the job on the execute machine can now be disabled, which is now
the default.
\Ticket{5601}

\item The \Condor{schedd} will now send submitter ad updates for idle submitters
less frequently than updates for submitters that have jobs in the queue. There
are two new configuration variables to control this behavior.
\MacroNI{ABSENT\_SUBMITTER\_LIFETIME} is the number of seconds after the last
job for that submitter leaves the queue that the submitter will continue to
send updates to the \Condor{collector}.  It defaults to 1 week.
\MacroNI{ABSENT\_SUBMITTER\_UPDATE\_RATE} is the maximum rate in seconds at which
the \Condor{schedd} will send updates to the \Condor{collector} for a submitter
that has no jobs in the queue. It defaults to 5 minutes. 
\Ticket{5559}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug that caused the \Condor{schedd} to exit when receiving
an updated X.509 proxy for a job.
\Ticket{5645}

\item In expressions in the Job Router's configuration, attributes no
longer require a 'TARGET.' scope prefix.
\Ticket{5550}

\item Fixed a bug in \Condor{q} \Opt{-xml} that would put the XML header
after the body unless \Opt{-stream} was passed.
\Ticket{5597}

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-5-3}Version 8.5.3}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.5.3 released on March 24, 2016.

\end{itemize}

\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item \MacroNI{ENABLE\_IPV4} and \MacroNI{ENABLE\_IPV6} both now accept
the special value "AUTO", which is true if an interface with the corresponding
protocol exists on the host, and false otherwise.
\Ticket{5524}

\item \MacroNI{ENABLE\_IPV4} and \MacroNI{ENABLE\_IPV6} both now default
to the special value "AUTO".  Additionally, the new configuration macro
\MacroNI{PREFER\_IPV4} is true by default.  This macro causes HTCondor to
prefer IPv4 over IPv6 when choosing an address to advertise, when choosing
the address of daemon looked up in the collector, and when resolving DNS
queries.
\Ticket{5104}

\item New configuration macros added: \MacroNI{IPV4\_ADDRESS},
\Macro{IPV6\_ADDRESS}, \MacroNI{IP\_ADDRESS\_IS\_V6}.
\Ticket{5512}

\item New attributes have been added to the Submitter ClassAd to indicate
the number of Idle and Running jobs for Scheduler universe and for Local
universe.
\Ticket{5519}

\item Jobs can now be submitted to the SLURM batch scheduling system via
the new \SubmitCmdNI{slurm} type in the grid universe.
\Ticket{5515}

\item In addition to logging to the file \MacroNI{KERNEL\_TUNING\_LOG},
the default \MacroNI{LINUX\_KERNEL\_TUNING\_SCRIPT} now also logs to
syslog and \File{/etc/systcl.d/99-htcondor.conf}.
\Ticket{5489}

\item \Condor{history} \Opt{-autoformat} now supports the j option to print
job ids like \Condor{q} does.
\Ticket{5558}

\item HTCondor is now built and linked with Globus 6.0.
\Ticket{5520}

\item Pre-size the ClassAd hash table to improve the performance of the
\Condor{collector} when getting ClassAd updates.
\Ticket{5551}

\item The negotiator now forwards accounting information to the collector,
where it can be easily queried and monitored.
\Ticket{5491}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug on \Condor{history} that could result in truncation of
the job id field.
\Ticket{5527}

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-5-2}Version 8.5.2}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.5.2 released on February 18, 2015.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item \Bold{\Condor{q} now defaults to showing only the current user's
jobs, unless the current user is a queue superuser.} This behavior
can be turned off by setting the new configuration option \Macro{CONDOR\_Q\_ONLY\_MY\_JOBS}
to \Expr{False} in the configuration for either the \Condor{schedd} or \Condor{q}. It can also be 
turned off by passing the new \Opt{-allusers} command line option to \Condor{q}.
\Ticket{5271}

\item Added support for immutable job attributes and protected job attributes.
\Ticket{5065}

\item Improved the speed of \Condor{q} and other tools when
querying non-local servers.
\Ticket{5150}

\item The new \Opt{-batch} command line option to \Condor{q} can be used to show a single
line of progress information for a batch of jobs, where a batch is either an entire workflow (a DAG, including sub-DAGs), all
of the jobs in a cluster, all of the jobs from a single user that have the same executable specified in their submit file,
or all of the jobs from a single user that have the same batch name.
\Ticket{4976}

\item \Condor{submit} and \Condor{submit\_dag} both have a new command line option \Opt{-batch-name}
which can be used to set the batch name used by \Condor{q} \Opt{-batch}.
\Ticket{5490}

\item \Condor{q} and \Condor{status} now attempt to avoid truncating data by making use of the
full width of the terminal.
\Ticket{5429}
\Ticket{5459}

\item Docker Universe jobs now report and update
ResidentSetSize, ImageSize, MemoryUsage, NetworkInput, and 
NetworkOutput attributes in the job ad and log file.
\Ticket{5456}

\item Added the capability to set ClassAd attributes for a
\Condor{dagman} job within the DAG file by using the new
\MacroNI{SET\_JOB\_ATTR} command.  (See section~\ref{sec:DAG-SetAttributes}
for details.)
\Ticket{5107}

\item The \File{dagman.out} file produced by \Condor{dagman} now has event
timestamps added to the lines that report \Condor{dagman} reading
a log event.  For example:
\begin{verbatim}
  01/13/16 11:29:03 Event: ULOG_SUBMIT for HTCondor Node NodeA (674.0.0) {01/13/16 11:28:59}
\end{verbatim}
The timestamp in curly brackets at the end is the actual timestamp
of the event.
\Ticket{5439}

\item The \Opt{-run} and \Opt{-hold} arguments of \Condor{q} used to produce garbage output
when used with other formatting options such as \Opt{-format}.  Now they will always constrain
the query, and will also set the output format when used by themselves.
\Ticket{11}

\item The \Condor{status} \Opt{-verbose} argument has been removed;
the equivalent \Opt{-long} argument should be used instead.
% No ticket for this -- wenger 2016-02-11

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item On Windows, configuring HTCondor to restrict the range of outbound
port numbers may cause substantial delays when using the command-line
tools.  Since we now know that it's not free to do so, \MacroNI{LOWPORT}
and \MacroNI{HIGHPORT} no longer restrict the port numbers of outbound
connections on Windows.  If you still require this functionality, use
\MacroNI{OUT\_LOWPORT} and \MacroNI{OUT\_HIGHPORT}.
\Ticket{4711}

\item Fixed a bug that could cause a daemon to be in the wrong
privilege state when attempting to act as the user.
\Ticket{5467}

\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-5-1}Version 8.5.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.5.1 released on December 21, 2015.

\item Shared port is enabled by default.
\Ticket{3813}
\Ticket{5103}

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \Condor{startd} history file now contains the peak
memory usage, by an exited job, not the more recent.
\Ticket{5436}

\item When the \Condor{starter} evicts a job, perhaps because
it has exceeded a memory limit, it does not transfer back to
the submit machine the sandbox of working files.  This is
consistent with other types of holds.
\Ticket{5437}

\item The \Condor{startd} now advertises the following attributes
on Linux machines: CpuFamily CpuModelNumber CacheSize.  These are
pulled from the /proc/cpuinfo file.
\Ticket{5323}

\item \Condor{q} has a new option \Opt{-schedd-constraint} which can be used
to constrain the queues displayed when using the \Opt{-global} option.
\Ticket{5043}

\item When an HTCondor-C job is submitted to a remote \Condor{schedd},
the remote job ad now includes the attribute \AdAttr{SubmitterGlobalJobId},
whose value is the same as the attribute \AdAttr{GlobalJobId} in the
original HTCondor-C job.
\Ticket{3472}

\item The \Condor{schedd} now sets environment variables for scheduler
universe jobs so that the jobs can more easily find the \Condor{schedd}'s
contact information.
On machines where there are multiple \Condor{schedd}s running, this helps
DAGMan and similar applications contact the \Condor{schedd} that started
them.
\Ticket{5166}

\item When \MacroNI{SEC\_ENABLE\_MATCH\_PASSWORD\_AUTHENTICATION} is set
to \Expr{True}, the related authorizations are now automatically enabled.
Previously, \Expr{submit-side@matchsession} and
\Expr{execute-side@matchsession} entries had to be added to the
\MacroNI{ALLOW\_DAEMON} and \MacroNI{ALLOW\_CLIENT} (if set)
authorization parameters in order for this feature to work.
\Ticket{5304}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item 

\Condor{history} \-run on a pool with partitionable slots now shows
the correct dynamic slot.
\Ticket{4261}

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-5-0}Version 8.5.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

%\item HTCondor version 8.5.0 not yet released.
\item HTCondor version 8.5.0 released on October 12, 2015.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \Condor{startd} history file contains two new attributes: BadputCausedByDraining and BadputCausedByPreemption, two boolean-valued attributes which are true if the job was evicted not by a user request.
\Ticket{5255}

\item The python bindings have a new Claim API, allowing Computing-On-Demand (COD) to be
invoked via python.
\Ticket{5130}

\item The python bindings can now submit multiple distinct processes using the \texttt{submitMany}
method, similar to a \Condor{submit} file with multiple \texttt{queue} statements.
\Ticket{4916}

\item The python bindings now provide improved support for managing multiple concurrent queries.
\Ticket{5187}

\item As an experimental feature, the python bindings implement the HTCondor negotiation protocol.
\Ticket{5125}

\item Changed \AdStr{Condor} to \AdStr{HTCondor} in \Condor{dagman}
output (mainly in the \File{dagman}.out file).
\Ticket{5144}

\item The new configuration parameter \MacroNI{JOB\_SPOOL\_PERMISSIONS}
controls the permissions on a job's spool directory managed by the
\Condor{schedd} on unix.
It defaults to the value \Expr{user}, which results in a permissions
value of \Expr{0700}.
Other valid values are \Expr{group} (permissions \Expr{0750}) and
\Expr{world} (permissions \Expr{0755}).
Previously, all job spool directories had access permissions of \Expr{0755}.
\Ticket{4896}

\item The \Condor{schedd} no longer changes the ownership of spooled job
files that it manages.
