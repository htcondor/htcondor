%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-5-2}Version 8.5.2}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.5.2 released on February 18, 2015.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item \Bold{\Condor{q} now defaults to showing only the current user's
jobs, unless the current user is a queue superuser.} This behavior
can be turned off by setting the new configuration option \Macro{CONDOR\_Q\_ONLY\_MY\_JOBS}
to \Expr{False} in the configuration for either the \Condor{schedd} or \Condor{q}. It can also be 
turned off by passing the new \Opt{-allusers} command line option to \Condor{q}.
\Ticket{5271}

\item Added support for immutable job attributes and protected job attributes.
\Ticket{5065}

\item Improved the speed of \Condor{q} and other tools when
querying non-local servers.
\Ticket{5150}

\item The new \Opt{-batch} command line option to \Condor{q} can be used to show a single
line of progress information for a batch of jobs, where a batch is either an entire workflow (a DAG, including sub-DAGs), all
of the jobs in a cluster, all of the jobs from a single user that have the same executable specified in their submit file,
or all of the jobs from a single user that have the same batch name.
\Ticket{4976}

\item \Condor{submit} and \Condor{submit\_dag} both have a new command line option \Opt{-batch-name}
which can be used to set the batch name used by \Condor{q} \Opt{-batch}.
\Ticket{5490}

\item \Condor{q} and \Condor{status} now attempt to avoid truncating data by making use of the
full width of the terminal.
\Ticket{5429}
\Ticket{5459}

\item Docker Universe jobs now report and update
ResidentSetSize, ImageSize, MemoryUsage, NetworkInput, and 
NetworkOutput attributes in the job ad and log file.
\Ticket{5456}

\item Added the capability to set ClassAd attributes for a
\Condor{dagman} job within the DAG file by using the new
\MacroNI{SET\_JOB\_ATTR} command.  (See section~\ref{sec:DAG-SetAttributes}
for details.)
\Ticket{5107}

\item The \File{dagman.out} file produced by \Condor{dagman} now has event
timestamps added to the lines that report \Condor{dagman} reading
a log event.  For example:
\begin{verbatim}
  01/13/16 11:29:03 Event: ULOG_SUBMIT for HTCondor Node NodeA (674.0.0) {01/13/16 11:28:59}
\end{verbatim}
The timestamp in curly brackets at the end is the actual timestamp
of the event.
\Ticket{5439}

\item The \Opt{-run} and \Opt{-hold} arguments of \Condor{q} used to produce garbage output
when used with other formatting options such as \Opt{-format}.  Now they will always constrain
the query, and will also set the output format when used by themselves.
\Ticket{11}

\item The \Condor{status} \Opt{-verbose} argument has been removed;
the equivalent \Opt{-long} argument should be used instead.
% No ticket for this -- wenger 2016-02-11

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item On Windows, configuring HTCondor to restrict the range of outbound
port numbers may cause substantial delays when using the command-line
tools.  Since we now know that it's not free to do so, \MacroNI{LOWPORT}
and \MacroNI{HIGHPORT} no longer restrict the port numbers of outbound
connections on Windows.  If you still require this functionality, use
\MacroNI{OUT\_LOWPORT} and \MacroNI{OUT\_HIGHPORT}.
\Ticket{4711}

\item Fixed a bug that could cause a daemon to be in the wrong
privilege state when attempting to act as the user.
\Ticket{5467}

\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-5-1}Version 8.5.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.5.1 released on December 21, 2015.

\item Shared port is enabled by default.
\Ticket{3813}
\Ticket{5103}

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \Condor{startd} history file now contains the peak
memory usage, by an exited job, not the more recent.
\Ticket{5436}

\item When the \Condor{starter} evicts a job, perhaps because
it has exceeded a memory limit, it does not transfer back to
the submit machine the sandbox of working files.  This is
consistent with other types of holds.
\Ticket{5437}

\item The \Condor{startd} now advertises the following attributes
on Linux machines: CpuFamily CpuModelNumber CacheSize.  These are
pulled from the /proc/cpuinfo file.
\Ticket{5323}

\item \Condor{q} has a new option \Opt{-schedd-constraint} which can be used
to constrain the queues displayed when using the \Opt{-global} option.
\Ticket{5043}

\item When an HTCondor-C job is submitted to a remote \Condor{schedd},
the remote job ad now includes the attribute \AdAttr{SubmitterGlobalJobId},
whose value is the same as the attribute \AdAttr{GlobalJobId} in the
original HTCondor-C job.
\Ticket{3472}

\item The \Condor{schedd} now sets environment variables for scheduler
universe jobs so that the jobs can more easily find the \Condor{schedd}'s
contact information.
On machines where there are multiple \Condor{schedd}s running, this helps
DAGMan and similar applications contact the \Condor{schedd} that started
them.
\Ticket{5166}

\item When \MacroNI{SEC\_ENABLE\_MATCH\_PASSWORD\_AUTHENTICATION} is set
to \Expr{True}, the related authorizations are now automatically enabled.
Previously, \Expr{submit-side@matchsession} and
\Expr{execute-side@matchsession} entries had to be added to the
\MacroNI{ALLOW\_DAEMON} and \MacroNI{ALLOW\_CLIENT} (if set)
authorization parameters in order for this feature to work.
\Ticket{5304}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item 

\Condor{history} \-run on a pool with partitionable slots now shows
the correct dynamic slot.
\Ticket{4261}

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-5-0}Version 8.5.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

%\item HTCondor version 8.5.0 not yet released.
\item HTCondor version 8.5.0 released on October 12, 2015.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \Condor{startd} history file contains two new attributes: BadputCausedByDraining and BadputCausedByPreemption, two boolean-valued attributes which are true if the job was evicted not by a user request.
\Ticket{5255}

\item The python bindings have a new Claim API, allowing Computing-On-Demand (COD) to be
invoked via python.
\Ticket{5130}

\item The python bindings can now submit multiple distinct processes using the \texttt{submitMany}
method, similar to a \Condor{submit} file with multiple \texttt{queue} statements.
\Ticket{4916}

\item The python bindings now provide improved support for managing multiple concurrent queries.
\Ticket{5187}

\item As an experimental feature, the python bindings implement the HTCondor negotiation protocol.
\Ticket{5125}

\item Changed \AdStr{Condor} to \AdStr{HTCondor} in \Condor{dagman}
output (mainly in the \File{dagman}.out file).
\Ticket{5144}

\item The new configuration parameter \MacroNI{JOB\_SPOOL\_PERMISSIONS}
controls the permissions on a job's spool directory managed by the
\Condor{schedd} on unix.
It defaults to the value \Expr{user}, which results in a permissions
value of \Expr{0700}.
Other valid values are \Expr{group} (permissions \Expr{0750}) and
\Expr{world} (permissions \Expr{0755}).
Previously, all job spool directories had access permissions of \Expr{0755}.
\Ticket{4896}

\item The \Condor{schedd} no longer changes the ownership of spooled job
files that it manages.
Now, the files are always owned by the submitting user.
The previous behavior of changing ownership to/from the \Expr{condor}
account can be restored by setting the new configuration parameter
\Macro{CHOWN\_JOB\_SPOOL\_FILES} to \Expr{True}.
\Ticket{5226}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}
