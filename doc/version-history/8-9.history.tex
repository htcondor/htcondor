%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of HTCondor.
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-9-0}Version 8.9.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.9.0 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.9.0 released on Month Date, 2018.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item  Normally, HTCondor requires the user to specify their credentials
when using EC2 (via the grid universe or via \Condor{annex}).  This allows
users to use different accounts from the same machine.  However,
if a user started an EC2 instance with the privileges necessary to start
other instances, and ran HTCondor in that instance, HTCondor was unable to
use that instance's privileges; the user still had to specify their
credentials.  Instead, the user may now specify ``FROM INSTANCE'' instead
of the name of a credential file to indicate that HTCondor should use the
instance's credentials.

By default, any user with access to a privileged EC2 instance has access to
that instance's privileges.  If you would like to make use of this feature,
please read \ref{sec:Instance Roles} before adding privileges (an instance
role) to an instance which allows access by other users, specifically
including the submitting of jobs to or running jobs on that instance.
\Ticket{6789}

\item the \Condor{hdfs} daemon which allowed the hdfs daemons to run under
the \Condor{master} has been removed from the contributed source. 
\Ticket{6809}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.
