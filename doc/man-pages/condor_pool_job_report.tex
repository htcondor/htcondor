\Description

\Condor{pool\_job\_report} is a Linux-only 
tool that is designed to be run nightly using \Prog{cron}.
It is intended to be run on the central manager, 
or another machine that has administrative permissions,
and is able to fetch the \Condor{startd} history logs
from all of the \Condor{startd} daemons in the pool.
After fetching these logs, 
\Condor{pool\_job\_report} then generates a report about job run times
and mails it to administrators, 
as defined by configuration variable \Macro{CONDOR\_ADMIN}.

\ExitStatus

\Condor{pool\_job\_report} will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) 
upon success,
and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.
