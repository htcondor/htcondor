\Description

\Condor{release} releases jobs from the HTCondor job queue that were 
previously placed in hold state.  
If the \Opt{-name} option is specified, the named \Condor{schedd} is targeted
for processing.  
Otherwise, the local \Condor{schedd} is targeted.
The jobs to be released are identified by one or more job identifiers, as
described below.
For any given job, only the owner of the job or one of the queue super users
(defined by the \MacroNI{QUEUE\_SUPER\_USERS} macro) can release the job.

	\OptItem{\Arg{user}}{Release jobs belonging to specified user}
	\OptItem{\OptArg{-constraint}{expression}} {Release all jobs which match
	                the job ClassAd expression constraint}
        \OptItem{\Arg{-all}}{Release all the jobs in the queue}
