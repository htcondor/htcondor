\Description

\Condor{submit} is the program for submitting jobs for execution
under HTCondor.
\Condor{submit} requires a submit description file which contains commands
to direct the queuing of jobs.
One submit description file may contain
specifications for the queuing of many HTCondor jobs at once.
A single invocation of \Condor{submit} may cause one or
more clusters.
A cluster is a set of jobs
specified in the submit description file
between \SubmitCmd{queue} commands for which the executable is not changed.
It is advantageous to submit
multiple jobs as a single cluster because:
\begin{itemize}
\item Only one copy of the checkpoint file is needed to 
represent all jobs in a cluster until they begin execution.
\item There is much less overhead involved for HTCondor to start the next
job in a cluster than for HTCondor to start a new cluster.  This can make
a big difference when submitting lots of short jobs.
\end{itemize}

Multiple clusters may be specified within a single
submit description file.
Each cluster must specify a single executable.

The job ClassAd attribute \Attr{ClusterId} identifies a cluster.
See specifics for this attribute
in the Appendix on page~\pageref{sec:Job-ClassAd-Attributes}.

Note that submission of jobs from a Windows machine requires
a stashed password to allow HTCondor to impersonate the user submitting
the job.
To stash a password, use the \Condor{store\_cred} command.
See the manual page at
page~\pageref{man-condor-store-cred} for details.

For lengthy lines within the submit description file,
the backslash (\Bs) is a line continuation character.
Placing the backslash at the end of a line causes the current line's command
to be continued with the next line of the file.
Submit description files may contain comments.
A comment is any line beginning with a pound character (\verb@#@). 

\begin{Options}

\OptItem{\Opt{-verbose}}{Verbose output - display the created job ClassAd}

\OptItem{\Opt{-unused}}{As a default, causes no warnings to be issued about
  user-defined macros not being used within the submit description file.
  The meaning reverses (toggles) when
  the configuration variable \Macro{WARN\_ON\_UNUSED\_SUBMIT\_FILE\_MACROS}
  is set to the non default value of \Expr{False}.
  Printing the warnings can help identify spelling
  errors of submit description file commands.  The warnings are sent
  to stderr. }

\OptItem{\OptArg{-name}{schedd\_name}}{Submit to the specified \Condor{schedd}.
Use this option to submit to a \Condor{schedd} other than the default local one.
\Arg{schedd\_name} is the value of the \Attr{Name} ClassAd attribute on
the machine where the \Condor{schedd} daemon runs.}


\OptItem{\OptArg{-remote}{schedd\_name}}{Submit to the specified
\Condor{schedd}, spooling all required input files over the network connection.
\Arg{schedd\_name} is the value of the \Attr{Name} ClassAd attribute
on the machine where the \Condor{schedd} daemon runs.
This option is equivalent to using both \Opt{-name} and \Opt{-spool}.}

\OptItem{\OptArg{-addr}{\Sinful{ip:port}}}{Submit to the \Condor{schedd} at
the IP address and port given by the \Term{sinful string} argument 
\Arg{\Sinful{ip:port}}.}

\OptItem{\OptArg{-pool}{pool\_name}}{Look in the specified pool for the 
\Condor{schedd} to submit to.
This option is used with \Opt{-name} or \Opt{-remote}.}

\OptItem{\Opt{-disable}}{Disable file permission checks
  when submitting a job for read permissions on all input files, 
  such as those defined by 
  commands \SubmitCmd{input} and \SubmitCmd{transfer\_input\_files},
  as well as write permission to output files, such as a
  log file defined by \SubmitCmd{log} and output files defined with 
  \SubmitCmd{output} or \SubmitCmd{transfer\_output\_files}.  }

\OptItem{\OptArg{-password}{passphrase}}{Specify a password to the 
\Prog{MyProxy} server. }

\OptItem{\Opt{-debug}}{Cause debugging information to be sent to \File{stderr},
based on the value of the configuration variable \MacroNI{TOOL\_DEBUG}.}

\OptItem{\OptArg{-append}{command}}{Augment the commands in the submit 
description file with the given command.
This command will be considered to immediately precede the Queue
command within the submit description file, and come after all other
previous commands.
The submit description file is not modified.
Multiple commands are specified by using the \Opt{-append} option multiple times.
Each new command is given in a separate \Opt{-append} option.
Commands with spaces in them will need to be enclosed in double quote
marks.}

\OptItem{\Opt{-spool}}{Spool all required input files, job event log, and
proxy over the connection to the \Condor{schedd}.
After submission, modify
local copies of the files without affecting your jobs. Any output
files for completed jobs need to be retrieved with \Condor{transfer\_data}.}

\OptItem{\OptArg{-dump}{filename}}{Sends all ClassAds to the specified
  file, instead of to the \Condor{schedd}.}

\OptItem{\Opt{-interactive}}{Indicates
  that the user wants to run an interactive shell on an execute machine 
  in the pool.
  This is equivalent to creating a submit description file 
  of a vanilla universe sleep job, 
  and then running \Condor{ssh\_to\_job} by hand.
  Without any additional arguments, 
  \Condor{submit} with the -interactive flag creates a dummy
  vanilla universe job that sleeps, 
  submits it to the local scheduler, 
  waits for the job to run, 
  and then launches \Condor{ssh\_to\_job} to run a shell.
  If the user would like to run the shell on a machine that matches 
  a particular \SubmitCmd{requirements} expression, 
  the submit description file is specified, and it will contain the expression.
  Note that all policy expressions specified in the submit 
  description file are honored, but any \SubmitCmd{executable} or
  \SubmitCmd{universe} commands are overwritten to be sleep and vanilla.
  The job ClassAd attribute \Attr{InteractiveJob} is set to \Expr{True}
  to identify interactive jobs for \Condor{startd} policy usage.  }

\OptItem{\Arg{submit description file}}{The path and file name of 
the submit description file. 
If this optional argument is missing or is the dash character (\Expr{-}),
then the commands are taken from standard input.}

\end{Options}

\ExitStatus

\Condor{submit} will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success, and a
non-zero value upon failure.

\Examples

\begin{itemize} 
\item{Submit Description File Example 1:} This example queues three jobs for
execution by HTCondor. The first will be given command line arguments of
\Arg{15} and \Arg{2000}, and it will write its standard output
to \File{foo.out1}.
The second will be given command line arguments of 
\Arg{30} and \Arg{2000}, and it will
write its standard output to \File{foo.out2}.
Similarly the third will have
arguments of 
\Arg{45} and \Arg{6000}, and it will use \File{foo.out3} for its standard
output. Standard error output (if any) from all three programs will
appear in \File{foo.error}.

\item{Submit Description File Example 2:} This submit description file
example queues 150
runs of program \Prog{foo} which must have been compiled and linked for
an Intel x86 processor running RHEL 3.
HTCondor will not attempt
to run the processes on machines which have less than 32 Megabytes of
physical memory, and it will run them on machines which have at least 64
Megabytes, if such machines are available.
Stdin, stdout, and stderr will
refer to \File{in.0}, \File{out.0}, and \File{err.0} for the first run
of this program (process 0).
Stdin, stdout, and stderr will refer to
\File{in.1}, \File{out.1}, and \File{err.1} for process 1, and so forth.
A log file containing entries
about where and when HTCondor runs, takes checkpoints, and migrates processes
in this cluster will be written into file \File{foo.log}.

in the submit description file causes this to happen.

\end{itemize} 


\GenRem
\begin{itemize}

\item For security reasons, HTCondor will refuse to run any jobs submitted
by user root (UID = 0) or by a user whose default group is group wheel
(GID = 0). Jobs submitted by user root or a user with a default group of
wheel will appear to sit forever in the queue in an idle state. 

\item All path names specified in the submit description file must be
less than 256 characters in length, and command line arguments must be
less than 4096 characters in length; otherwise, \Condor{submit} gives a
warning message but the jobs will not execute properly. 

\item Somewhat understandably, behavior gets bizarre if the user makes
the mistake of requesting multiple HTCondor jobs to write to the
same file, and/or if the user alters any files that need to be accessed
by an HTCondor job which is still in the queue.
For example, the compressing of data or
output files before an HTCondor job has completed is a common mistake.

\item To disable checkpointing for Standard Universe jobs, include the
line:
\begin{verbatim}
      +WantCheckpoint = False
\end{verbatim}
in the submit description file before the queue command(s).
