\Description
\Condor{q} displays information about jobs in the HTCondor job queue.  By
default, \Condor{q} queries the local job queue but this behavior may be 
modified by specifying:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the \Opt{-global} option, which queries all job queues in the pool
	\item a schedd name with the \Opt{-name} option, which causes the queue of 
		the named schedd to be queried 
	\item a submitter with the \Opt{-submitter} option, which causes all queues
		of the named submitter to be queried
\end{itemize}

To restrict the display to jobs of interest, a list of zero or more 
restrictions may be supplied.  Each restriction may be one of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item a \Arg{cluster} and a \Arg{process} matches jobs which
		belong to the specified cluster and have the specified process number
	\item a \Arg{cluster} without a \Arg{process} matches all jobs belonging
		to the specified cluster
	\item a \Arg{owner} matches all jobs owned by the specified owner
	\item a \OptArg{-constraint}{expression} which matches all jobs that
		satisfy the specified ClassAd expression. (See section~\ref{sec:classad-reference}
		for a discussion of ClassAd expressions.)
\end{itemize}
If no \Arg{owner} restrictions are present in the list, the job matches the 
restriction list if it matches at least one restriction in the list.  If 
\Arg{owner} restrictions are present, the job matches the list if it matches 
one of the \Arg{owner} restrictions \emph{and} at least one non-owner 
restriction.

If the \Opt{-long} option is specified, \Condor{q} displays a long description 
of the queried jobs by printing the entire job ClassAd.
The attributes of the job ClassAd may be displayed by means of the
\Opt{-format} option, which displays attributes with a \verb+printf(3)+
format.
Multiple \Opt{-format} options may be specified in the option list to display
several attributes of the job.
If neither \Opt{-long} or \Opt{-format} are specified, \Condor{q} displays a 
a one line summary of information as follows:

\begin{description}
\item[ID] The cluster/process id of the condor job. 
\item[OWNER] The owner of the job. 
\item[SUBMITTED] The month, day, hour, and minute the job was submitted to the 
	queue. 
\item[RUN\_TIME]  Wall-clock time accumulated by the job to date in days, 
	hours, minutes, and seconds.  
\item[ST] Current status of the job, which varies somewhat according
        to the job universe and the timing of updates.
        H = on hold,
        R = running,
%	S = suspended,
	I = idle
        (waiting for a machine to execute on), C = completed, 
        X = removed, and
        > = transferring output. 
\item[PRI] User specified priority of the job, ranges from -20 to +20, with 
	higher numbers corresponding to greater priority. 
\item[SIZE] The value of job ClassAd attribute \Attr{MemoryUsage} (in Mbytes),
when the attribute is defined, and \Attr{ImageSize} (in Kbytes), otherwise. 
\item[CMD] The name of the executable. 
\end{description}

If the \Opt{-dag} option is specified, the OWNER column is replaced
with NODENAME for jobs started by the \Condor{dagman} instance.

If the \Opt{-run} option is specified, the ST, PRI, SIZE, and CMD
columns are replaced with:

\begin{description}
\item[HOST(S)] The host where the job is running.
\end{description}

If the \Opt{-globus} option is specified, the ST, PRI, SIZE, and CMD
columns are replaced with:
\begin{description}
\item[STATUS] The state that HTCondor believes the job is in.
Possible values are
  \begin{description}
    \item[PENDING] The job is waiting for resources to become available
    in order to run.
    \item[ACTIVE] The job has received resources, and the application
    is executing.
    \item[FAILED] The job terminated before completion because of an error,
    user-triggered cancel, or system-triggered cancel.
    \item[DONE] The job completed successfully.
    \item[SUSPENDED] The job has been suspended.
    Resources which were allocated for this job may have been
    released due to a scheduler-specific reason.
    \item[UNSUBMITTED] The job has not been submitted to the scheduler yet,
    pending the reception of the 
    GLOBUS\_GRAM\_PROTOCOL\_JOB\_SIGNAL\_COMMIT\_REQUEST signal from a client.
    \item[STAGE\_IN] The job manager is staging in files,
    in order to run the job.
    \item[STAGE\_OUT] The job manager is staging out files
    generated by the job.
    \item[UNKNOWN]
  \end{description}
\item[MANAGER] 
A guess at what remote batch system is running the job.
It is a guess, because HTCondor looks at the Globus jobmanager contact
string to attempt identification.
If the value is fork, the job is running on the
remote host without a jobmanager.
Values may also be condor, lsf, or pbs.
\item[HOST] The host to which the job was submitted.
\item[EXECUTABLE] The job as specified as the executable in the
submit description file.
\end{description}

If the \Opt{-goodput} option is specified, the ST, PRI, SIZE, and CMD
columns are replaced with:

\begin{description}
\item[GOODPUT] The percentage of RUN\_TIME for this job which has been
saved in a checkpoint.  A low GOODPUT value indicates that the job is
failing to checkpoint.  If a job has not yet attempted a checkpoint,
this column contains \texttt{[?????]}.
\item[CPU\_UTIL] The ratio of CPU\_TIME to RUN\_TIME for checkpointed
work.  A low CPU\_UTIL indicates that the job is not running
efficiently, perhaps because it is I/O bound or because the job
requires more memory than available on the remote workstations.  If
the job has not (yet) checkpointed, this column contains \texttt{[??????]}.
\item[Mb/s] The network usage of this job, in Megabits per second of
run-time.
\end{description}

If the \Opt{-io} option is specified, the ST, PRI, SIZE, and CMD columns
are replaced with:

\begin{description}
\item{READ} The total number of bytes the application has read from files and sockets.
\item{WRITE} The total number of bytes the application has written to files and sockets.
\item{SEEK} The total number of seek operations the application has performed on files.
\item{XPUT} The effective throughput (average bytes read and written per second)
from the application's point of view.
\item{BUFSIZE} The maximum number of bytes to be buffered per file.
\item{BLOCKSIZE} The desired block size for large data transfers.
\end{description}

These fields are updated when a job produces a checkpoint or completes.
If a job
has not yet produced a checkpoint, this information is not available.

If the \Opt{-cputime} option is specified, the RUN\_TIME 
column is replaced with:

\begin{description}
\item[CPU\_TIME] The remote CPU time accumulated by the job to date
(which has been stored in a checkpoint) in days, hours, minutes, and
seconds.  (If the job is currently running, time accumulated during
the current run is \emph{not} shown.  If the job has not produced a checkpoint,
this column contains 0+00:00:00.)
\end{description}

The \Arg{-analyze} option may be used to determine why certain jobs are not
running by performing an analysis on a per machine basis for each machine in 
the pool.  The reasons may vary among failed constraints, insufficient priority,
resource owner preferences and prevention of preemption by the 
\Macro{PREEMPTION\_REQUIREMENTS} expression.  If the \Arg{-long} option is specified 
along with the \Arg{-analyze} option, the reason for failure is displayed on a 
per machine basis.

\begin{Options}

    specified in the configuration file.}
  \OptItem{\Opt{-analyze}}{Perform an analysis to determine how
    many resources are available to run the requested jobs.  These results
    are only meaningful for jobs using HTCondor's matchmaker.  This option
    is never meaningful for Scheduler universe jobs and only meaningful
    for grid universe jobs doing matchmaking.}
  \OptItem{\Opt{-run}}{Get information about running jobs.}
  \OptItem{\Opt{-hold}}{Get information about jobs in the hold state.

  \OptItem{\Opt{-goodput}}{Display job goodput statistics.}
  \OptItem{\Opt{-io}}{Display job input/output summaries.}
  \OptItem{\Opt{-dag}}{Display DAG node jobs under their \Condor{dagman} 
    instance. Child nodes are listed using indentation to show the structure
    of the DAG. }
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-name}{name}}{Show only the job queue of the named schedd}
  \OptItem{\Opt{-long}}{Display job ads in long format}
  \OptItem{\Opt{-xml}}{Display job ads  in XML format.
    The XML format is fully defined in the reference manual,
    obtained from the ClassAds web page, with a link at
    \URL{http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/research.html}.}
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-attributes}{Attr1 [,Attr2 \Dots]}}{Explicitly list the 
  attributes (by name, and in a comma separated list)
  which should be displayed when using the \Opt{-xml} or \Opt{-long} options.
  Limiting the number of attributes increases the efficiency of the query.}
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-format}{fmt attr}}{Display attribute or 
    expression \Arg{attr} in format \Arg{fmt}.
    To display the attribute or expression the format must contain a single
    \Code{printf(3)}-style conversion specifier.
    Attributes must be from the job ClassAd.
    Expressions are ClassAd expressions and may 
    refer to attributes in the job ClassAd.
    If the attribute is not present in a given ClassAd and cannot
    be parsed as an expression,
    then the format option will be silently skipped.
    The conversion specifier must match the type of the
    attribute or expression.
    \%s is suitable for strings such as \Attr{Owner},
    \%d for integers such as \Attr{ClusterId},
    and \%f for floating point numbers such as \Attr{RemoteWallClockTime}.  
    \%v identifies the type of the attribute,
    and then prints the value in an appropriate format.
    \%V identifies the type of the attribute,
    and then prints the value in an appropriate format as it would
    appear in the \Opt{-long} format.
    As an example, strings used with \%V will have quote marks.
    An incorrect format will result in undefined behavior.
    Do not use more than one conversion specifier in a given
    format.  More than one conversion specifier will result
    in undefined behavior.  To output multiple attributes
    repeat the \Opt{-format} option once for each desired attribute.
    Like {\Code{printf(3)}} style formats, one may include other
    text that will be reproduced directly.   
    A format without any conversion specifiers may be specified,
    but an attribute is still required.
    Include \Bs n to specify a line break. }

  \OptItem{\OptArg{-autoformat[:tn,lVh]}{attr1 [attr2 ...]}} {
    (Custom option) Display machine ClassAd attribute values 
    formatted in a default way according to their attribute types.  
    This option takes an arbitrary number of attribute names as arguments,
    and prints out their values.  It is like the \Opt{-format} option,
    but no format strings are required.
    It is assumed that no attribute names begin with a dash character,
    so that the next word that begins with dash is the 
    start of the next option.
    The \Opt{autoformat} option may be followed by a colon character
    and formatting qualifiers:

    \textbf{t} add a tab character before each field instead of 
    the default space character,

    \textbf{n} add a newline character after each field,

    \textbf{,} add a comma character after each field,

    \textbf{l} label each field,

    \textbf{V} use \%V rather than \%v for formatting,

    \textbf{h} print headings before the first line of output.

    The newline and comma characters may \emph{not} be used together.
    }
  \OptItem{\Opt{-cputime}} {Instead of wall-clock allocation time (RUN\_TIME), 
    display remote CPU time accumulated by the job to date in days,
    hours, minutes, and seconds.  (If the job is currently running, time
    accumulated during the current run is \emph{not} shown.)}
  \OptItem{\Opt{-currentrun}} {Normally, RUN\_TIME contains all the time
    accumulated during the current run plus all previous runs.  If this
    option is specified, RUN\_TIME only displays the time accumulated so
    far on this current run.}
  \OptItem{\Opt{-avgqueuetime}} {Display the average of time spent in the
    queue, considering all jobs not completed (those that do not have
    \Expr{JobStatus == 4} or \Expr{JobStatus == 3}.  }
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-jobads}{file}}{Display jobs from a list of
    ClassAds from a file, instead of the real ClassAds from the
    \Condor{schedd} daemon.
    This is most useful for debugging purposes.
    The ClassAds appear as if
    \Condor{q} \Opt{-l} is used with the header stripped out.}
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-userlog}{file}}{Display jobs, with job information coming
    from a user log,
    instead of from the real ClassAds from the \Condor{schedd} daemon.
    This is most useful for automated testing of the status of jobs known to be
    in the given user log, because it reduces the load on the \Condor{schedd}.
    A user log does not contain all of the job information, so some fields in
    the normal output of \Condor{q} will be blank.}
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-machineads}{file}}{When doing analysis, use the
    machine ads from the file instead of the ones from the
    \Condor{collector} daemon. 
    This is most useful for debugging purposes. 
    The ClassAds appear as if \Condor{status} \Opt{-l} is used.}
  \OptItem{\Opt{-stream-results}}{Display results as jobs are fetched
    from the job queue rather than storing results in memory until all
    jobs have been fetched.  This can reduce memory consumption when fetching
    large numbers of jobs, but if \Condor{q} is paused while displaying
    results, this could result in a timeout in communication with
    \Condor{schedd}.}
  \OptItem{\Opt{-wide}}{If this option is specified, and the command portion
    of the output would cause the output to extend beyond 80 columns,
    display beyond the 80 columns. }
  \OptItem{Restriction list}{The restriction list may have zero or more items,
    each of which may be:
        \begin{description}
        \item[\Arg{cluster}] match all jobs belonging to cluster
        \item[\Arg{cluster.proc}] match all jobs belonging to cluster with
        a process number of \emph{proc}
        \item[\OptArg{-constraint}{expression}] match all jobs which match
        the ClassAd expression constraint
        \end{description} 
    A job matches the restriction list if it matches any restriction in the 
    list  Additionally, if \Arg{owner} restrictions are supplied, the job
    matches the list only if it also matches an \Arg{owner} restriction.}
\end{Options}

\GenRem

The default output from \Condor{q} is formatted to be human readable,
not script readable.
In an effort to make the output fit within 80 characters, values in
some fields might be truncated.
Furthermore, the HTCondor Project can (and does) change the formatting
of this default output as we see fit.
Therefore, any script that is attempting to parse data from \Condor{q}
is strongly encouraged to use the \Opt{-format} option (described
above, examples given below).

Although \Arg{-analyze} provides a very good first approximation, the analyzer 
cannot diagnose all possible situations because the analysis is based on 
instantaneous and local information.  Therefore, there are some situations 
(such as when several submitters are contending for resources, or if the pool 
is rapidly changing state) which cannot be accurately diagnosed.

\Arg{-goodput}, \Arg{-cputime}, and \Arg{-io} are most useful for STANDARD
universe jobs, since they rely on values computed when a job
checkpoints.

It is possible to to hold jobs that are in the X state, to avoid this it 
is best to construct a \OptArg{-constraint}{expression} that contains
'JobStatus != 3' if the user wishes to avoid this condition. 

\Examples

The \Opt{-format} option provides a way to specify both the job attributes
and formatting of those attributes.
There must be only one conversion specification per \Opt{-format} option.
As an example, to list only Jane Doe's jobs in the queue,
choosing to print and format only the owner of the job,
the command line arguments for the job, and the
process ID of the job:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
%condor_q -submitter jdoe -format "%s" Owner -format " %s " Args -format "ProcId = %d\n" ProcId
jdoe 16386 2800 ProcId = 0
jdoe 16386 3000 ProcId = 1
jdoe 16386 3200 ProcId = 2
jdoe 16386 3400 ProcId = 3
jdoe 16386 3600 ProcId = 4
jdoe 16386 4200 ProcId = 7
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

To display only the JobID's of Jane Doe's jobs you can use the following.
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
%condor_q -submitter jdoe -format "%d." ClusterId -format "%d\n" ProcId
27.0
27.1
27.2
27.3
27.4
27.7
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

An example that shows the difference (first set of output)
between not using an option to \Condor{q} and (second
set of output) using the \Opt{-globus} option:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}

 ID      OWNER            SUBMITTED     RUN_TIME ST PRI SIZE CMD
 100.0   smith          12/11 13:20   0+00:00:02 R  0   0.0  sleep 10

1 jobs; 0 idle, 1 running, 0 held



 ID      OWNER          STATUS  MANAGER  HOST                EXECUTABLE
 100.0   smith         ACTIVE fork     grid.example.com       /bin/sleep
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\ExitStatus

\Condor{q} will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success,
and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.
