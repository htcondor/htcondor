\Description
\Condor{history} displays a summary of all condor jobs listed in the
specified history files.  If no history files are specified (with the \Opt{-f} option), the local
history file as specified in Condor's configuration file
(~condor/spool/history by default) is read.  The default listing
summarizes each job on a single line, and  contains the following items:

\index{Condor commands!condor\_history}
\index{condor\_history command}

\begin{description}
\item[ID] The cluster/process id of the condor job. 
\item[OWNER] The owner of the job. 
\item[SUBMITTED] The month, day, hour, and minute the job was submitted to the queue. 
\item[CPU\_USAGE] Remote user CPU time accumulated by the job to date in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
\item[ST] Completion status of the job (C = completed and X = removed).
\item[COMPLETED] The time the job was completed.
\item[PRI] User specified priority of the job, ranges from -20 to +20, with higher numbers corresponding to greater priority. 
\item[SIZE] The virtual image size of the executable in megabytes. 
\item[CMD] The name of the executable. 
\end{description}

If a job ID (in the form of cluster\_id or cluster\_id.proc\_id) or an
owner is provided, output will be restricted to jobs with the
specified IDs and/or submitted by the specified owner.  
The -constraint option can be used to display jobs that satisfy a
specified boolean expression.

\begin{Options}
    \OptItem{\Opt{-help}}{Get a brief description of the supported options}
    \OptItem{\OptArg{-f}{filename}}{Use the specified file instead of the default history file}
    \OptItem{\OptArg{-constraint}{expr}}{Display jobs that satisfy the expression}
    \OptItem{\Opt{-l}}{Display job ads in long format}
    \OptItem{\OptArg{-completedsince}{postgrestimestamp}}{Display only job
      ads that were in the Completed job state on or after the date and
      time given by the \Arg{postgrestimestamp}. 
      The \Arg{postgrestimestamp} follows the syntax as given for
      \Prog{postgres} version 8.0.}
