\Description 

\Condor{fetchlog} contacts Condor running on the machine specified by
\Arg{machine-name}, and asks it to return a log file from that
machine.  The log file is determined by combining the log file name
for the specified subsystem (e.g. STARTER) with the optional extension
(e.g. ``.vm2'').  This simplifies the retrieval of log file by
bypassing the need to log on to the machine in order to get the log
file.

For security purposes of authentication and authorization, 
this command requires an administrator's level of access.
See section~\ref{sec:Config-Security} 
on page~\pageref{sec:Config-Security} for more details about Condor's
security mechanisms.

The \Arg{subsystem[.extension]} argument identifies the log file to retrieve.
It is defined by the \Arg{subsystem}\_LOG entry
given in the configuration file.  The optional extension is appended
to this file name (e.g. ``STARTER.vm1'' becomes ``StarterLog.vm1'').
For \MacroNI{COLLECTOR\_LOG}, it is \MacroNI{COLLECTOR}.
The complete list of log files are defined by
\begin{verbatim}
  MASTER
  COLLECTOR
  NEGOTIATOR
  NEGOTIATOR_MATCH
  SCHEDD
  SHADOW
  STARTD
  STARTER
  KBDD
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Options}
    \ToolArgsBaseDesc
    \OptItem{\OptArg{-pool}{centralmanagerhostname[:portnumber]}}
    {Specify a pool by giving the central manager's host name
    and an optional port number}

\end{Options}

\Examples
To get the \Condor{negotiator} daemon's log from a host named 
\File{head.example.com} from within the current pool:
\begin{verbatim}
condor_fetchlog head.example.com NEGOTIATOR
\end{verbatim}

To get the \Condor{startd} daemon's log from a host named
\File{execute.example.com} from within the current pool:
\begin{verbatim}
condor_fetchlog execute.example.com STARTD
\end{verbatim}

This command requested the \Condor{startd} daemon's log from the
\Condor{master}.
If the \Condor{master} has crashed or is unresponsive,
ask another daemon
running on that computer to return the log.
For example, ask the \Condor{startd} daemon to return the
\Condor{master}'s log:

\begin{verbatim}
condor_fetchlog -startd execute.example.com MASTER
\end{verbatim}

\ExitStatus
\Condor{fetchlog} will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success,
and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.
