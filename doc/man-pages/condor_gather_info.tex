\Description

\Note  The usage information that the 
HTCondor versions 7.7.3 and 7.7.4 \Condor{gather\_info} tool outputs
is not quite correct.
This manual page is more accurate for those releases.

\Condor{gather\_info} will collect and output information 
about the machine it is run upon,
about the HTCondor installation local to the machine, 
and optionally about a specified HTCondor job. 
The information gathered by this tool is most often used as a debugging aid
for the developers of HTCondor.

Without the \verb@--@\textbf{jobid} option, information about the
local machine and its HTCondor installation is gathered and
placed into the file called \File{condor-profile.txt},
in the current working directory. 
Specification of the information gathered is given in 
the \Bold{General Remarks} section below, 
under the category of Identity.

With the \verb@--@\textbf{jobid} option, 
additional information is gathered about the job identified by
its \Attr{ClusterId} and \Attr{ProcId} ClassAd attributes.
This information includes both categories as given in
the \Bold{General Remarks} section below:
Identity and Job information.
As the quantity of information can be extensive,
this information is placed into a compressed tar file.
The file is placed into the current working directory,
and it is named using the format
\File{cgi-<username>-jid<ClusterId>.<ProcId>-<year>-<month>-<day>-<hour>\_<minute>\_<second>-<TZ>.tar.gz}, where all values within \verb@<>@ are substituted
with current values.
The building of this potentially large tar file can require a fair
amount of temporary space.
If the \verb@--@\textbf{scratch} option is specified,
it identifies a directory in which to build the tar file.
If the \verb@--@\textbf{scratch} option is \emph{not} specified, 
then the directory will be \File{/tmp/cgi-<PID>},
where the process ID is that of the \Condor{gather\_info} executable.


\begin{Options}
  \OptItem{\OptArg{---jobid}{$<$ClusterId.ProcId$>$}}
  {Data mine information about this HTCondor job from the local 
  HTCondor installation and \Condor{schedd}.}
  \OptItem{\OptArg{---scratch}{/path/to/directory}}
  {A path to temporary space needed when building the output tar file.
  Defaults to \File{/tmp/cgi-<PID>}, where \Expr{<PID>} is replaced by
  the process ID of \Condor{gather\_info}.}
\end{Options}

\Files

\begin{description}
  \item{\File{condor-profile.txt}} The Identity portion of the information 
  gathered when \Condor{gather\_info} is run without arguments.
  \item{\File{cgi-<username>-jid<cluster>.<proc>-<year>-<month>-<day>-<hour>\_<minute>\_<second>-<TZ>.tar.gz}} The output file which contains all of 
  the information produced by this tool.
\end{description}

\ExitStatus

\Condor{gather\_info} will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success,
and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.
