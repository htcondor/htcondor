condor (7.7.5~dfsg.1-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New primary Debian maintainer contact is Condor upstream. Previous
    maintainer remains uploader.
  * Guard against failure due to missing directories in pre-removal script
    (Closes: #662739). Thanks to Andreas Beckmann for detecting the bug.
  * Fix DMTCP integration for version 1.2.4 and later -- file location tests
    became invalid.
  * Set default DMTCP snapshotting interval to zero -- no regular snapshotting,
    but on-demand snapshots on vacate command. In addition the shim script now
    honors DMTCP_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL.
  * Call dmtcp_command with option --quiet in shim_dmtcp to achieve more
    readable logs, by suppressing DMTCP's license and author boilerplate
    output.
  * Added patch to ignore PIDs from a stale PID file when trying to stop
    condor. This could otherwise prevent package removal/upgrade
    (Closes: #663033). The patch has been forwarded upstream.
  * Cherry-pick upstream patch that let's Condor build on all Debian-derived
    distributions identically. This patch allows the unmodified Debian package
    to build on Ubuntu.
  * Cherry-pick upstream patch to bump the libclassad SO version from 2 to 3
    -- fixed an overlooked and somewhat hidden change of API. Should now be
    stable for the 7.8 series. Also changed associated package name and
    dependencies accordingly.
  * Let DMTCP perform a blocking checkpointing operation, to avoid Condor
    killing DMTCP before a checkpoint file is written completely
    (Closes: #663078).
  * Make an attempt to let shim_dmtcp remove DMTCP checkpoint output files
    from a job's EXEC_DIR upon job termination. This is experimental.

condor (7.7.5~dfsg.1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Feature freeze for upcoming 7.8 stable series.
    - better statistics for monitoring a Condor pool,
    - better support for absent ads in the collector
    - fast claiming of partitionable slots
    - support for some newer Linux kernel features to better support process
      isolation.
  * Remove 'disable_java_gt4X' patch -- corresponding upstream code has been
    removed.
  * Remove 'debian_dynamic_run' patch -- merged upstream.

condor (7.7.4+git3-gd7ce75b~dfsg.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Initial upload to Debian experimental (Closes: #233482).
    After acceptance into Debian an upload to unstable is expected to happen
    once a build-time test suite is operational.
  * Drop NeuroDebian team as maintainer, upstream will eventually become the
    primary maintainer, with Michael Hanke being the uploader for the time
    being.
  * Merge commits from 7.7.4 maintenance branch.
  * Enable GSOAP support.

condor (7.7.4-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Forcing runtime dependency on libcgroup1 (>= 0.37~), as otherwise Condor's
    procd refuses to start.
  * Fix problem in the Debconf setup that caused the initially provided
    settings to be overwritten during installation on a clean system (without
    and existing Condor installation).
  * Modify condor_qsub to always execute submitted scripts via the configured
    shell and not directly (expecting them to be executable). The seems to be
    the behavior of SGE's qsub.

condor (7.7.4-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. RPATH setup now officially supported.
  * Added emulator for SGE-style qsub calls (condor_qsub; incl. manpage).
  * Update DMCTP shim script to version 0.4.
  * Added dependency to libdate-manip-perl for condor_gather_info.
  * Remove patch to disable scimark in favor of proper configuration default.

condor (7.7.1+git837-g37b7fa3-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream code. Support for dynamic linking against system
    libraries. Condor's internal libs have been merged into a single
    library.
  * Fix build-deps on BOOST.
  * Bumped Standards-version to 3.9.2; no changes necessary.
  * Build using embedded classad library -- upstream will (or did) stop
    releasing it separately. libclassad binary packages are now built from
    the Condor source package.
  * Drop shared library, sysapi and postgres patches -- merged or obsolete.
  * Adjust rules for now included doc source code.
  * Add sanity checks into maintainer script to avoid creating bogus
    directories and installation errors. Thanks to Mats Rynge for reporting.
  * Add Python as runtime dependency.
  * Add patch to make condor_run work with Condor's new file transfer
    behavior. Courtesy of Jaime Frey.
  * Stop building a PDF version of the manual (takes long, and segfaults
    ghostscript at the moment). Keep HTML version.
  * Add patch to provide a sane default configuration for ssh_to_job and
    install condor_ssh_to_job_sshd_config_template as a conffile in
    /etc/condor/.
  * Added condor-dev package, containing headers files and static versions of
    Condor libraries.
  * Add build-dep on libldap-dev to ensure nordugrid_gahp being built.
  * Added DMTCP integration for snapshotting of vanilla universe jobs.

condor (7.6.1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Adjust shared library patch.

condor (7.6.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream stable release.
  * Adjusted patches.
  * Added missing debhelper dependencies.
  * Added missing sysv-style init script symlinks.
  * Fixed various typos.
  * Prevent local classad header files from being used, in favor of
    system-wide libclassad installations.

condor (7.5.5+git995-ga9a0d2a-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream code from V7.6 branch. Updated various patches, removed some
    merged ones.
  * No longer compile the 'contrib' parts -- upstream recommended it due to
    lack of stability.
  * Added patch to create /var/run/condor upon daemon startup with proper
    permissions. That helps to conform to the FHS that declares /var/run as
    volatile and to be cleaned upon boot. Moreover, some systems have /var/run
    mounted as tmpfs.

condor (7.5.4+git567-gb10f6b4-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Applied patch to allow adding submit specs in condor_run calls. Thanks to
    Matthew Farrellee <matt@redhat.com>.
  * Improved configuration for a "Personal Condor". Bind network traffic to
    the loopback interface. Better documentation in the generated
    configuration file.
