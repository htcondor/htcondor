Description: workload management system
 Like other full-featured batch systems, Condor provides a job queueing
 mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme, resource monitoring, and
 resource management. Users submit their serial or parallel jobs to Condor,
 Condor places them into a queue. It chooses when and where to run the jobs
 based upon a policy, carefully monitors their progress, and ultimately
 informs the user upon completion.
 .
 Unlike more traditional batch queueing system, Condor can also effectively
 harness wasted CPU power from otherwise idle desktop workstations. Condor
 does not require a shared file system across machines - if no shared file
 system is available, Condor can transfer the job's data files on behalf of
 the user.
 .
 The Debian package uses Debconf to determine an appropriate initial
 configuration for a machine that shall join an existing Condor pool, and
 moreover, allows creating a "Personal" (single machine) Condor pool
 automatically.
