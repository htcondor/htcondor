Description: distributed workload management system
 Like other full-featured batch systems, Condor provides a job queueing
 mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme, resource monitoring, and
 resource management. Users submit their serial or parallel jobs to Condor;
 Condor places them into a queue. It chooses when and where to run the jobs
 based upon a policy, carefully monitors their progress, and ultimately
 informs the user upon completion.
 .
 Unlike more traditional batch queueing systems, Condor can also effectively
 harness wasted CPU power from otherwise idle desktop workstations. Condor
 does not require a shared file system across machines - if no shared file
 system is available, Condor can transfer the job's data files on behalf of
 the user.
 .
 This package can set up an appropriate initial configuration at install
 time for a machine intended either as a member of an existing Condor pool
 or as a "Personal" (single machine) Condor pool.

Package: libclassad-dev
Replaces: libclassad0-dev
Conflicts: libclassad0-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: libclassad3 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: Condor classads expression language - development library
 Classified Advertisements (classads) are the lingua franca of Condor, used for
 describing jobs, workstations, and other resources. There is a protocol for
 evaluating whether two classads match, which is used by the Condor central
 manager to determine the compatibility of jobs, and workstations where they
 may be run.
 .
 This package provides the static library and header files.
