Usage:  $scriptname [OPTIONS] [<command> [<command_args>]]

The primary purpose of this emulation is to allow SGE-style submission of
dependent jobs without the need to specify the full dependency graph at
submission time. This implementation is neither as efficient as Condor's
DAGMan, nor as functional as SGE's qsub/qalter. It merely serves as a minimal
adaptor to be able to use software original written to interact with SGE in a
Condor pool.

In general $scriptname behaves just like qsub. However, only a fraction of the
original functionality is available. The following list of options only
describes the differences in the behavior of SGE's qsub and this emulation.
Qsub options not listed here are not supported.

Options:

-b <y|n>
  If 'y', command and arguments given on the command line are wrapped into a
  shell script which is then submitted to Condor.

-cwd
  If given, this option will cause the 'initialdir' value in the Condor submit
  file to be set to the current directory.

-e <filename|path>
  Name of the file to contain the STDERR output of the job. By default this will
  be job_name.ejob_id[.task_id]. If an existing directory is specified, the file
  will be placed inside this directory using the default schema for the
  filename.

-h,--help
  Print usage summary and option list.

-hold_jid <jid>
  If given, the job will be submitted in 'hold' state. Along with the actual job
  a 'sentinel' job will be submitted to Condor's local universe. This sentinel
  watches the specified job and releases the submitted job whenever the job has
  completed. The sentinel observes SGE's behavior to detect job exiting with
  code 100 and not start depedent job in this case. If a cluster id of an array
  job is given the dependent job will only be released after all individual jobs
  of a cluster have completed.

-l <ressource spec>
  This option is currently ignored.

-m <a|e|n><...>
  SGE's notification labels will be translated (approximately) into Condor's
  notifications states (Never, Error, Complete).

-M <email>
  Added as 'notify_user' to the submit file.

-N <jobname>
  Determines the default name of logfile (stdout, stderr).

-o <filename|path>
  See -e option, but for a job's stdout.

-p <int>
  Added a 'priority' to the submit file.

-r <y|n>
  This option is currently ignored.

-S <shell>
  Path to a shell binary for script execution.

-shell <y|n>
  This option is currently ignored.

-t <start>[-<stop>[:<step>]]
  Task ID specification for array job submissions.

-q <queue name>
  This option is permanently ignored, as Condor doesn't have multiple queues.

-V
  If given, 'getenv = True' is added to the submit file.

--version
  Print version information and exit.
