%description
HTCondor is a specialized workload management system for
compute-intensive jobs. Like other full-featured batch systems, HTCondor
provides a job queuing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme,
resource monitoring, and resource management. Users submit their
serial or parallel jobs to HTCondor, HTCondor places them into a queue,
chooses when and where to run the jobs based upon a policy, carefully
monitors their progress, and ultimately informs the user upon
completion.
