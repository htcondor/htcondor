Description: distributed workload management system
 Like other full-featured batch systems, HTCondor provides a job queueing
 mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme, resource monitoring, and
 resource management. Users submit their serial or parallel jobs to HTCondor;
 HTCondor places them into a queue. It chooses when and where to run the jobs
 based upon a policy, carefully monitors their progress, and ultimately
 informs the user upon completion.
 .
 Unlike more traditional batch queueing systems, HTCondor can also effectively
 harness wasted CPU power from otherwise idle desktop workstations. HTCondor
 does not require a shared file system across machines - if no shared file
 system is available, HTCondor can transfer the job's data files on behalf of
 the user.
 .
 This package can set up an appropriate initial configuration at install
 time for a machine intended either as a member of an existing HTCondor pool
 or as a "Personal" (single machine) HTCondor pool.
