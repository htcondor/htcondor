condor (7.8.8~dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Brian Lin ]
  * New upstream bug fix release.
    - Fixed a bug in condor_advertise that could cause failure to publish
    ClassAds to condor_collector daemons other than the first one in the list of
    condor_collector daemons (Ticket #3404).
    - Fixed a bug that could cause HTCondor daemons to abort on condor_reconfig
    when the value of configuration variable STATISTICS_WINDOW_SECONDS was
    reduced. (Ticket #3443).
    - If condor_shared_port was using a dynamic port and the condor_master was
    using the shared port, then if condor_shared_port died, all subsequent
    attempts to restart it on a different port failed. (Ticket #3478).
    - Reduced the likelihood of a problem that caused the condor_master to
    restart some of its children after a recent reconfiguration, because the
    condor_master incorrectly concluded that the children were hung. (Ticket
    #3510)
    - Now installs the condor_kbdd daemon.
    - Does no longer provide condor_glidein
    - Fix a number of bashisms (Closes: #690640)
  * Added patch to automatically retry glexec operations if they exit with an
    error code likely caused by a transient error (Ticket 2415).

  [ Michael Hanke ]
  * Add Brian Lin as a maintainer.
  * Adjust code to determine Condor's upstream version in debian/rules'
    get-orig-source target.
  * Add citation information in debian/upstream. Thanks to Andreas Tille.
  * Add explicit note to README.Debian that the standard universe is not
    supported at this point (Closes: #717357).

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Sat, 20 Jul 2013 12:51:53 +0200

condor (7.8.7~dfsg.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release.
    - Fixed a bug wherein running the condor_suspend command on a scheduler
      universe job would cause the schedd to crash (Ticket 3259).
    - Jobs that were submitted with condor_submit -spool and failed during
      submission were left indefinitely in the queue in the Hold state
      (Ticket 3200).
    - When using privilege separation, jobs would be put on hold after
      they finished running if the working directory contained links to
      files that were not globally readable (Ticket 2904).
    - condor_master would sometimes crash on reconfiguration when the
      High Availability configuration had changed (Ticket 3292).
  * Condor is now officially called HTCondor. The Debian package will keep the
    name 'condor' for now and change when switching to the 7.9 or 8.0 series.

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:47:47 +0100

condor (7.8.6~dfsg.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release (skipped 7.8.5).
    - Avoid rare crashes of condor_schedd in association with jobs that have
      'noop_job = true' (Ticket 3156).
    - Fix condor_startd crash when failing to match a partitionable slot after
      the application of configuration variables of the MODIFY_REQUEST_EXPR_
      category (Ticket 3260).
    - Prevent removal of scheduler universe jobs from the job queue when they
      should have been requeued, according to policy. This caused condor_dagman
      jobs to fail to restart. This bug exists in all Condor versions 7.8.0
      through 7.8.4. Upon upgrading from these Condor versions, users will need
      to intervene in order to restart their dagman jobs (Ticket 3207).

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Tue, 06 Nov 2012 08:22:29 +0100

condor (7.8.4~dfsg.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release (missed 7.8.3). This release addresses four
    security-related issues, as well as numerous other bug fixes
    (Closes: #688210):
    - Security Item: Some code that was no longer used was removed. The presence
      of this code could expose information which would allow an attacker to
      control another user's job. (CVE-2012-3493)
    - Security Item: Some code that was no longer used was removed. The presence
      of this code could have lead to a Denial-of-Service attack which would
      allow an attacker to remove another user's idle job. (CVE-2012-3491)
    - Security Item: Filesystem (FS) authentication was improved to check the
      UNIX permissions of the directory used for authentication. Without this,
      an attacker may have been able to impersonate another submitter on the
      same submit machine. (CVE-2012-3492)
    - Security Item: Although not user-visible, there were multiple updates to
      remove places in the code where potential buffer overruns could occur,
      thus removing potential attacks. None were known to be exploitable.
    - Security Item: Although not user-visible, there were updates to the code
      to improve error checking of system calls, removing some potential
      security threats. None were known to be exploitable.
    - The full changelog listing numerous additional bugs is available at
      http://research.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.8/9_3Stable_Release.html
  * Added patch to fix a FTBFS on alpha, due to missing getpid syscall.

condor (7.8.2~dfsg.1-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Make postinst script more robust against missing config variables (Closes:
    #684667). Patch is courtesy of Tim Cartwright.
  * Disable Condor's file transfer mechanism for jobs submitted via
    condor_qsub, because a shared filesystem is assumed for these jobs
    (Closes: #684879).
  * This time really remove dangling symlink /usr/sbin/condor -> ../bin/condor.
    This file no longer exists (Closes: #678425).
  * Support deployment scenario where the administrative 'condor' user is not
    a local system user, but is shared (e.g. through LDAP) by all machines in a
    Condor pool (see installation manual section 3.2). The condor package will
    accept to run under an existing non-system user account named 'condor',
    but only when that account is locked, i.e. not login is possible
    (Closes: #684463).

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Sun, 12 Aug 2012 19:20:35 +0200

condor (7.8.2~dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Upstream security release. Prevent an attacker who is manipulating
    reverse-DNS entries and is able to connect to a Condor daemon to gain
    access to a Condor pool that is using DNS/hostname host-based authentication
    (only). CVE-2012-3416

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Thu, 16 Aug 2012 08:32:49 +0200

condor (7.8.1~dfsg.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove dangling symlink /usr/sbin/condor -> ../bin/condor. This file no
    longer exists (Closes: #678425).
  * Add Debconf template translations:
    - Czech -- courtesy of Martin Å Ãn <martin.sin@zshk.cz>
      (Closes: #678952)
    - Spanish -- courtesy of Fernando C. Estrada <fcestrada@fcestrada.com>
      (Closes: #680201)
  * Only issue 'condor_restart' command in postinst, when condor_master is
    actually running. If that is not the case, for example when daemon
    startup is prevented by system policy, package installation would fail
    otherwise. Thanks to Andreas Beckmann for the report. (Closes: #681144)

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Jun 2012 18:40:11 +0200

condor (7.8.1~dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release:
    - Fixed a bug in the condor init script that would cause
      the init script to hang if condor wasn't running (Ticket 2872)
    - Fixed a bug that caused Parallel Universe jobs using Parallel
      Scheduling Groups to occasionally stay idle even when there were
      available machines to run them (Ticket 3017)
    - Fixed a bug that caused the Condor GridManager to crash when
      attempting to submit jobs to a local PBS/LSF/SGI cluster
      (Ticket 3014)
    - Fixed a bug in the handling of local universe jobs which caused
      the Condor SCHEDD to log a spurious ERROR message every time a local
      universe job exited, and then further caused the statistics for local
      universe jobs to be incorrectly computed (Ticket 3008)
    - Fixed a bug when Condor runs under the PrivSep model, in which if a job
      created a hard link from one file to another, Condor was unable to
      transfer the files back to the submit side, and the job was put on hold.
      (Ticket 2987)
    - When configuration variables MaxJobRetirementTime or MachineMaxVacateTime
      were very large, estimates of machine draining badput and completion time
      were sometimes nonsensical because of integer overflow (Ticket 3001)
    - Fixed a bug where per-job sub-directories and their contents in the
      SPOOL directory would not be removed when the associated job left the
      queue (Ticket 2942). Closes: #663031
  * Updated Swedish Debconf translation (Closes: #676943).

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Wed, 06 Jun 2012 10:39:35 +0200

condor (7.8.0~dfsg.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Actually include the Russian, Italian, and Polish translations.
  * Add Debconf template translations:

    - Portuguese -- courtesy of Pedro Ribeiro <p.m42.ribeiro@gmail.com>
      (Closes: #674943)
  * Add explicit dependency on Python (for condor_router_history).
  * Remove word duplication from package description.
  * Fix typos in debian/copyright.

condor (7.8.0~dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #670304). This is the first release of the
    new 7.8 stable series. Patches introduced to prevent FTBFS on mips, ia64
    and s390x are merged/obsolete.
  * Add Debconf template translations (Closes: #670487):

condor (7.7.6~dfsg.1-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Temporarily drop cgroups dependency and, consequently, support for cgroups
    in Condor. The cgroups package is not in the condition to migrate into
    wheezy, hence blocking Condor's migration as well. cgroups maintainer
    suggests to drop this dependency for now.
    http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2012/04/msg00617.html
  * Improved Debconf templates after review by debian-l10n-english. Thanks
    to Justin B. Rye and Christian Perrier.
  * Add Debconf template translations:
    - Danish -- courtesy of Joe Dalton (Closes: #671090).

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Wed, 02 May 2012 08:13:55 +0200

condor (7.7.6~dfsg.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add upstream patch to address FTBFS on ia64 and s390x (Closes: #670393).

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Wed, 25 Apr 2012 18:18:08 +0200

condor (7.7.6~dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream development release. Last one before the 7.8 stable series.
  * Majority of patches has been merged upstream or have been made obsolete.
  * Stop supporting alternative LOCAL_DIR settings via Debconf. In addition
    the pre/postrm scripts no longer support non-standard (aka /var) LOCAL_DIR
    settings. This was done to be able to keep runtime data (logs, etc.) when
    the package gets removed, but not purged (Closes: #668088). Previously the
    package relied on Condor's own configuration facilities to deduce LOCAL_DIR,
    which is impossible to perform in 'postrm'.
  * Do not remove the condor user during package purge (Closes: #667533).
    Along the lines of the discussion in #621833 the user is kept in a locked
    state (condor user has login disabled by default).
  * Simplify logic of adding the condor system user in maintainer scripts.
  * Change daemon restart behavior on package upgrade -- confirmed with
    upstream. Condor is now kept running during package upgrade (was
    unconditionally stopped in prerm before). Upon finishing installtion of
    the new version, Condor is just started (if not already running) and a
    'condor_restart' command is issued. Before a complete stop-start cycle was
    performed. The new behavior should allow for a more graceful upgrade of
    Condor pools, by safely shutting down all running jobs and jobs submitted
    from the localhost.
  * Add patch to allow building on MIPS. Rename variable name 'mips' to
    'mips_' to avoid name clash (Closes: #669689).
  * Fix a bug in the debconf script that caused the default start policy
    setting for a personal Condor installation to have no effect, i.e. it
    would not run jobs regardless of machine activity by default.

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Apr 2012 20:15:31 +0200

condor (7.7.5~dfsg.1-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * New primary Debian maintainer contact is Condor upstream. Previous
    maintainer remains uploader.
  * Guard against failure due to missing directories in pre-removal script
    (Closes: #662739). Thanks to Andreas Beckmann for detecting the bug.
  * Fix DMTCP integration for version 1.2.4 and later -- file location tests
    became invalid.
  * Set default DMTCP snapshotting interval to zero -- no regular snapshotting,
    but on-demand snapshots on vacate command. In addition the shim script now
    honors DMTCP_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL.
  * Call dmtcp_command with option --quiet in shim_dmtcp to achieve more
    readable logs, by suppressing DMTCP's license and author boilerplate
    output.
  * Added patch to ignore PIDs from a stale PID file when trying to stop
    condor. This could otherwise prevent package removal/upgrade
    (Closes: #663033). The patch has been forwarded upstream.
  * Cherry-pick upstream patch that let's Condor build on all Debian-derived
    distributions identically. This patch allows the unmodified Debian package
    to build on Ubuntu.
  * Cherry-pick upstream patch to bump the libclassad SO version from 2 to 3
    -- fixed an overlooked and somewhat hidden change of API. Should now be
    stable for the 7.8 series. Also changed associated package name and
    dependencies accordingly.
  * Let DMTCP perform a blocking checkpointing operation, to avoid Condor
    killing DMTCP before a checkpoint file is written completely
    (Closes: #663078).
  * Make an attempt to let shim_dmtcp remove DMTCP checkpoint output files
    from a job's EXEC_DIR upon job termination. This is experimental.
  * Improve README.Debian regarding DMTCP checkpointing setup.
  * Bumped Standards-version to 3.9.3; no changes necessary.
  * Added homepage and VCS information to control file.

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Fri, 09 Mar 2012 13:20:25 +0100

condor (7.7.5~dfsg.1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Feature freeze for upcoming 7.8 stable series.
    - better statistics for monitoring a Condor pool,
    - better support for absent ads in the collector
    - fast claiming of partitionable slots
    - support for some newer Linux kernel features to better support process
      isolation.
  * Remove 'disable_java_gt4X' patch -- corresponding upstream code has been
    removed.
  * Remove 'debian_dynamic_run' patch -- merged upstream.

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Thu, 01 Mar 2012 08:47:40 +0100

condor (7.7.4+git3-gd7ce75b~dfsg.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Initial upload to Debian experimental (Closes: #233482).
    After acceptance into Debian an upload to unstable is expected to happen
    once a build-time test suite is operational.
  * Drop NeuroDebian team as maintainer, upstream will eventually become the
    primary maintainer, with Michael Hanke being the uploader for the time
    being.
  * Merge commits from 7.7.4 maintenance branch.
  * Enable GSOAP support.

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Feb 2012 08:37:32 +0100

condor (7.7.4-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Forcing runtime dependency on libcgroup1 (>= 0.37~), as otherwise Condor's
    procd refuses to start.
  * Fix problem in the Debconf setup that caused the initially provided
    settings to be overwritten during installation on a clean system (without
    and existing Condor installation).
  * Modify condor_qsub to always execute submitted scripts via the configured
    shell and not directly (expecting them to be executable). The seems to be
    the behavior of SGE's qsub.

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Jan 2012 14:01:27 +0100

condor (7.7.4-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. RPATH setup now officially supported.
  * Added emulator for SGE-style qsub calls (condor_qsub; incl. manpage).
  * Update DMCTP shim script to version 0.4.
  * Added dependency to libdate-manip-perl for condor_gather_info.
  * Remove patch to disable scimark in favor of proper configuration default.


 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Dec 2011 16:19:00 +0100

condor (7.7.1+git837-g37b7fa3-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream code. Support for dynamic linking against system
    libraries. Condor's internal libs have been merged into a single
    library.
  * Fix build-deps on BOOST.
  * Bumped Standards-version to 3.9.2; no changes necessary.
  * Build using embedded classad library -- upstream will (or did) stop
    releasing it separately. libclassad binary packages are now built from
    the Condor source package.
  * Drop shared library, sysapi and postgres patches -- merged or obsolete.
  * Adjust rules for now included doc source code.
  * Add sanity checks into maintainer script to avoid creating bogus
    directories and installation errors. Thanks to Mats Rynge for reporting.
  * Add Python as runtime dependency.
  * Add patch to make condor_run work with Condor's new file transfer
    behavior. Courtesy of Jaime Frey.
  * Stop building a PDF version of the manual (takes long, and segfaults
    ghostscript at the moment). Keep HTML version.
  * Add patch to provide a sane default configuration for ssh_to_job and
    install condor_ssh_to_job_sshd_config_template as a conffile in
    /etc/condor/.
  * Added condor-dev package, containing headers files and static versions of
    Condor libraries.
  * Add build-dep on libldap-dev to ensure nordugrid_gahp being built.
  * Added DMTCP integration for snapshotting of vanilla universe jobs.

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Tue, 11 Oct 2011 08:42:35 +0200

condor (7.6.1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Sat, 04 Jun 2011 20:36:29 -0400

condor (7.6.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream stable release.
  * Adjusted patches.
  * Added missing debhelper dependencies.
  * Added missing sysv-style init script symlinks.
  * Fixed various typos.
  * Prevent local classad header files from being used, in favor of
    system-wide libclassad installations.

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Mon, 18 Apr 2011 22:07:08 -0400

condor (7.5.5+git995-ga9a0d2a-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream code from V7.6 branch. Updated various patches, removed some
    merged ones.
  * No longer compile the 'contrib' parts -- upstream recommended it due to
    lack of stability.
  * Added patch to create /var/run/condor upon daemon startup with proper
    permissions. That helps to conform to the FHS that declares /var/run as
    volatile and to be cleaned upon boot. Moreover, some systems have /var/run
    mounted as tmpfs.

 -- Michael Hanke <mih@debian.org>  Tue, 15 Mar 2011 16:37:56 -0400

condor (7.5.4+git567-gb10f6b4-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low
