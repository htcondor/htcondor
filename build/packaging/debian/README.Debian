HTCondor for Debian
===================

The documentation for HTCondor can be found on the World Wide Web at:

http://htcondor.org/manual

At that web site, you will find both an on-line version of manual and
directions for downloading your own copy in a variety of formats.


Package upgrades
----------------

When the HTCondor package is upgraded it will restart the HTCondor daemons.
The Debian package does not perform a graceful shutdown
on upgrades, because there is a variety of possible procedures, where
subjective appropriateness depends on the configuration and utilization of a
particular HTCondor pool. Please see this page for more information on graceful
shutdowns:
