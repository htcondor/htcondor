# This version of gSOAP does something funny. It will add -DWITH_DOM
# when compiling its libraries but never compile dom.cpp so any
# program that links with the libraries will have undefined
# symbols. This was never a problem in the past because we never used
# the libraries, we compiled stdospa2.cpp ourselves and did not pass
# -DWITH_DOM. However, we are going to start using this external
# properly now and need to fix this bug. -matt 140907
