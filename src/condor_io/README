      Condor External Data Representation (Cedar) Class Library
			    Documentation

1. Introduction

The Cedar class library is used throughout Condor to provide a
platform-independent interface to and implementation of socket
services on versions of Unix and Windows NT.  Cedar handles integer
byte-order and size incompatibilities between machines, as well as
type differences across operating systems (for example, pid_t is
unsigned on some systems but signed on others).

2. C++ User Interface Overview

Cedar is implemented in C++ as a hierarchy of classes defined in the
condor_io directory of the Condor source tree.  Header files for these
classes can be found in the condor_includes directory.  The class
hierarchy is:

                              Stream
                                |
                                |
                               Sock
                               / \
                              /   \
                       SafeSock   ReliSock

The Stream class defines the connection-oriented, message-based
communication interface of Cedar.  The communication stream is toggled
between encode (send) mode and decode (receive) mode.  Depending on
the mode, a call to a code() method either sends or receives data of a
given type.  Since this interface is message-based, each communication
must end with a call to end_of_message() before changing the stream's
mode.  Since the code() method is used for both sending and receiving,
senders and receivers should look similar.  It is imperative that the
sender and receiver agree on the number and type of the data elements
sent in a message.  The following is a prototypical Cedar code
fragment:

	/* Process A */			/* Process B */
	int handshake(Stream *s) {	int handshake(Stream *s) {
	    int data = 5, result;	    int data, result;
	    char str[] = "myname";	    char *str = NULL;
	    s->encode();		    s->decode();
	    s->code(data);		    s->code(data);
	    s->code(str);		    s->code(str);
	    s->end_of_message();	    s->end_of_message();
					    result = verify(data, str);
					    free(str);
	    s->decode();		    s->encode();
	    s->code(result);		    s->code(result);
	    s->end_of_message();	    s->end_of_message();
	    return result;		    return result;
	}				}

Note that calls to end_of_message() in the sender and receiver must
match.  When in decode mode, end_of_message() flushes the buffered
data for the current message onto the network, returning failure when
a network error occurs.  In encode mode, end_of_message() verifies
that the receiver has reached the end of the message and if not,
returns failure and flushes any remaining data in this message.  The
code() and end_of_message() methods return 1 on success and 0 on
failure.  Applications should check for these return values (unlike in
the above code fragment), and handle errors appropriately.  Often,
when a receiver encounters an error while reading a message, the
receiver calls end_of_message() to discard the erroneous message and
begins processing the next message.

The Sock class defines an interface for connection establishment.
This interface is implemented with TCP in the ReliSock class and with
UDP in the SafeSock class.  ReliSock and SafeSock are the only Cedar
classes which should be instantiated; however, pointers to the Stream
base class are often used at points in the application where it is not
important if the underlying medium is TCP or UDP (for example, in a
daemon which handles the same commands over both TCP and UDP).

Further details of the Cedar C++ interface can be found in the header
files for these classes.

3. Network Interface

Over TCP, a Cedar message may consist of multiple "packets".  All
packets have a 5 byte header.  The first byte is 1 if this packet is
the final packet in the message and 0 otherwise.  The remaining 4
bytes contain a count of the number of data bytes in the message.
There is no trailer.  The byte count is used to determine
end-of-message.

Over UDP, a Cedar message is sent as a single UDP packet.  There is no
header or trailer.

Cedar sends all integers in 8 byte network order.  Integers less than
8 bytes in length are sign extended then converted to network order
before being sent.  On receipt, Cedar tests for overflow: an error
occurs when attempting to receive a negative value into an unsigned
integer or when attempting to receive a value larger (or smaller) than
the maximum (or minimum) values representable in the range of the
variable.

Cedar sends all floating point values as 8 byte network order integer
mantissa followed by 8 byte network order integer exponent.  The
standard C library functions frexp() and ldexp() are used to convert
between float/double values and mantissa/exponent representation.

All other data (char and opaque) is sent as is.

4. Use in Condor

Cedar communication in Condor is based on "commands".  To initiate a
communication, a process sends a command to its peer.  Commands are
messages which start with an integer (which identifies the command)
followed by any other needed data as specified by the protocol for
this command.  Condor daemons listen for incoming commands through the
DaemonCore interface.  When a command arrives, DaemonCore reads the
integer identifier and calls the registered handler for this command.
This handler reads any remaining data in the message and continues the
exchange by replying to the peer.

Cedar is not ClassAd aware.  The ClassAd library provides its own
methods for sending ClassAds through Cedar.
