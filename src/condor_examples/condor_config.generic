##  condor_config
##
##  This is the global configuration file for condor. This is where
##  you define where the local config file is. Any settings
##  made here may potentially be overridden in the local configuration
##  file.  KEEP THAT IN MIND!  To double-check that a variable is
##  getting set from the configuration file that you expect, use
##  condor_config_val -v <variable name>
##
##  condor_config.annotated is a more detailed sample config file
##
##  Unless otherwise specified, settings that are commented out show
##  the defaults that are used if you don't define a value.  Settings
##  that are defined here MUST BE DEFINED since they have no default
##  value.

##  Where have you installed the bin, sbin and lib condor directories?   
RELEASE_DIR = /usr/local/condor

##  Where is the local condor directory for each host?  This is where the local config file(s), logs and
##  spool/execute directories are located. this is the default for Linux and Unix systems.
#LOCAL_DIR = $(TILDE)
##  this is the default on Windows sytems
#LOCAL_DIR = $(RELEASE_DIR)

##  Where is the machine-specific local config file for each host?
LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE = $(LOCAL_DIR)/condor_config.local
##  If your configuration is on a shared file system, then this might be a better default
#LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE = $(RELEASE_DIR)/etc/$(HOSTNAME).local
##  If the local config file is not present, is it an error? (WARNING: This is a potential security issue.)
#REQUIRE_LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE = true

##  The normal way to do configuration with RPMs is to read all of the
##  files in a given directory that don't match a regex as configuration files.
##  Config files are read in lexicographic order.
LOCAL_CONFIG_DIR = $(LOCAL_DIR)/config
#LOCAL_CONFIG_DIR_EXCLUDE_REGEXP = ^((\..*)|(.*~)|(#.*)|(.*\.rpmsave)|(.*\.rpmnew))$

##  Use a host-based security policy. By default CONDOR_HOST and the local machine will be allowed
use SECURITY : HOST_BASED
##  To expand your condor pool beyond a single host, set ALLOW_WRITE to match all of the hosts
#ALLOW_WRITE = *.cs.wisc.edu
##  FLOCK_FROM defines the machines that grant access to your pool via flocking. (i.e. these machines can join your pool).
#FLOCK_FROM =
##  FLOCK_TO defines the central managers that your schedd will advertise itself to (i.e. these pools will give matches to your schedd).
#FLOCK_TO = condor.cs.wisc.edu, cm.example.edu
