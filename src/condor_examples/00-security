## Default security settings
##
## Host-based security was the default for the 8.8 series (and earlier).
##
## Host-based security assumes that all users on a machine are trusted.
## For example, if host-based security trusts that a given machine can 
## run jobs, then any user who can start a process on that machine can 
## start a startd that can "steal" jobs from the system.
#
## To help make HTCondor secure by default, we removed host-based security
## from the default configuration file in the 9.0 series
## (/etc/condor/condor_config).
##
## In the 24.0 series, we made some smaller changes to the default security
## configuration. The primary differences are making the defaults the same
## across all of the installation methods and allowing READ commands to
## proceed without authentication (instead of relying on a fake ANONYMOUS
## authentication method.
##
## To continue to use an older security configuration, 
## comment out the 'recommended' line below, and uncomment the
## appropriate alternate line.
##

# use security:host_based
# use security:recommended_v9_0
use security:recommended
