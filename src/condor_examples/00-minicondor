# HTCONDOR CONFIGURATION TO CREATE A POOL WITH ONE MACHINE
#
# This file was created upon initial installation of HTCondor.
# It contains configuration settings to set up a secure HTCondor
# installation consisting of **just one single machine**.
# YOU WILL WANT TO REMOVE THIS FILE IF/WHEN YOU DECIDE TO ADD ADDITIONAL
# MACHINES TO YOUR HTCONDOR INSTALLATION!  Most of these settings do
# not make sense if you have a multi-server pool.
#
# See the Quick Start Installation guide at:
#     https://htcondor.org/manual/quickstart.html
#

# ---  NODE ROLES  ---

# Every pool needs one Central Manager, some number of Submit nodes and
# as many Execute nodes as you can find. Consult the manual to learn
# about additional roles.

# Use my IP address for the Central Manager
CONDOR_HOST = $(IP_ADDRESS)
use ROLE: CentralManager
use ROLE: Submit
use ROLE: Execute

# --- PERFORMANCE TUNING SETTINGS ---

# Since there is just one server in this pool, we can tune various
# polling intervals to be much more responsive than the system defaults
# (which are tuned for pools with thousands of servers).  This will
# enable jobs to be scheduled faster, and job monitoring to happen more
# frequently.

# --- COMMON CHANGES ---

# Uncomment the lines below and do 'sudo condor_reconfig' if you wish
# condor_q to show jobs from all users with one line per job by default.
#CONDOR_Q_DASH_BATCH_IS_DEFAULT = False
