3.2.1 Preparing to Install Condor

   Before you install Condor at your site, there are a few important
   decisions you must make about the basic layout of your pool. These
   are:
   
   1.
          What machine will be the Central Manager?
   2.
          Will Condor run as root or not?
   3.
          Who will be administering Condor on the machines in your pool?
   4.
          Will you have a 'condor' user and will it's home directory be
          shared?
   5.
          Where should the machine-specific directories for Condor go?
   6.
          Where should the parts of the Condor system be installed?
          + Config Files
          + Release directory
               o User Binaries
               o System Binaries
               o Lib Directory
               o Etc Directory
          + Documentation
   7.
          Am I using AFS?
   8.
          Do I have enough disk space for Condor?
          
   If you feel you already know the answers to these questions, you can
   skip to the 'Installation Procedure' section below, section 3.2.2.
   If you are unsure about any of them, read on.
   
  What machine will be the Central Manager?
  
   One machine in your pool must be the Central Manager. You should setup
   and install Condor on this machine first. This is the centralized
   information repository for the Condor pool and is also the machine
   that does match-making between available machines and waiting jobs. If
   the Central Manager machine crashes, any currently active matches in
   the system will keep running, but no new matches will be made.
   Moreover, most Condor tools will stop working. Because of the
   importance of this machine for the proper functioning of Condor, we
   recommend you install it on a machine that is likely to stay up all
   the time, or at the very least, one that will be rebooted quickly if
   it does crash. Also, because all the daemons will send updates (by
   default every 5 minutes) to this machine, it is advisable to consider
   network traffic and your network layout when choosing your central
   manager.
   
  Will Condor run as root or not?
  
   We strongly recommend that you start up the Condor daemons as root.
   Otherwise, Condor can do very little to enforce security and policy
   decisions. If you don't have root access and would like to install
   Condor, under most platforms you can run Condor under any user you'd
   like. However, there are serious security consequences of this. Please
   see section 3.8.1 in the manual for details on
   running Condor as non-root.
   
  Who will be administering Condor on the machines in your pool?
  
   Either root will be administering Condor directly, or someone else
   would be acting as the Condor administrator. If root has delegated the
   responsibility to another person but doesn't want to grant that person
   root access, root can specify a condor_config.root file that will
   override settings in the other condor config files. This way, the
   global condor_config file can be owned and controlled by whoever is
   condor-admin, and the condor_config.root can be owned and controlled
   only by root. Settings that would compromise root security (such as
   which binaries are started as root) can be specified in the
   condor_config.root file while other settings that only control policy
   or condor-specific settings can still be controlled without root
   access.
   
  Will you have a 'condor' user and will it's home directory be shared?
  
   To simplify installation of Condor at your site, we recommend that you
   create a 'condor' user on all machines in your pool. The condor
   daemons will create files (such as the log files) owned by this user,
   and the home directory can be used to specify the location of files
   and directories needed by Condor. The home directory of this user can
   either be shared among all machines in your pool, or could be a
   separate home directory on the local partition of each machine. Both
   approaches have advantages and disadvantages. Having the directories
   centralized can make administration easier, but also concentrates the
   resource usage such that you potentially need a lot of space for a
   single shared home directory. See the section below on
   machine-specific directories for more details.
   
   If you choose not to create a condor user, you must specify via the
   CONDOR_IDS environment variable which uid.gid pair should be used for
   the ownership of various Condor files. See section 3.8.2 on ``UIDs
   in Condor'' in the manual for details.
   
  Where should the machine-specific directories for Condor go?
  
   Condor needs a few directories that are unique on every machine in
   your pool. These are 'spool', 'log', and 'execute'. Generally, all
   three are subdirectories of a single machine specific directory called
   the 'local directory' (specified by the LOCAL_DIR parameter in the
   config file).
   
   If you have a 'condor' user with a local home directory on each
   machine, the LOCAL_DIR could just be user condor's home directory
   ('LOCAL_DIR = $(TILDE)' in the config file). If this user's home
   directory is shared among all machines in your pool, you would want to
   create a directory for each host (named by hostname) for the local
   directory ('LOCAL_DIR = $(TILDE)/hosts/$(HOSTNAME)' for example). If
   you don't have a condor account on your machines, you can put these
   directories wherever you'd like. However, where to place them will
   require some thought, as each one has its own resource needs:
   
   execute
          This is the directory that acts as the current working
          directory for any Condor jobs that run on a given execute
          machine. The binary for the remote job is copied into this
          directory, so you must have enough space for that. (Condor
          won't send a job to a machine that doesn't have enough disk
          space to hold the initial binary). In addition, if the remote
          job dumps core for some reason, it is first dumped to the
          execute directory before it is sent back to the submit machine.
          So, you will want to put the execute directory on a partition
          with enough space to hold a possible core file from the jobs
          submitted to your pool.
          
   spool
          The spool directory holds the job queue and history files, and
          the checkpoint files for all jobs submitted from a given
          machine. As a result, disk space requirements for spool can be
          quite large, particularly if users are submitting jobs with
          very large executables or image sizes. By using a checkpoint
          server (see section 3.7.4 on ``Installing a Checkpoint
          Server'' for details), you can ease the disk
          space requirements, since all checkpoint files are stored on
          the server instead of the spool directories for each machine.
          However, the initial checkpoint files (the executables for all
          the clusters you submit) are still stored in the spool
          directory, so you will need some space, even with a checkpoint
          server.
          
   log
          Each Condor daemon writes its own log file which is placed in
          the log directory. You can specify what size you want these
          files to grow to before they are rotated, so the disk space
          requirements of the log directory are configurable. The larger
          the logs, the more historical information they will hold if
          there's a problem, but the more disk space they use up. If you
          have a network filesystem installed at your pool, you might
          want to place the log directories in a shared location (such as
          /usr/local/condor/logs/$(HOSTNAME)) so that you can view the
          log files from all your machines in a single location. However,
          if you take this approach, you will have to specify a local
          partition for the lock directory (see below).
          
   lock
          Condor uses a small number of lock files to synchronize access
          to some files that are shared between multiple daemons. Because
          of problems we've had with file locking and network filesystems
          (particularly NFS), these lock files should be placed on a
          local partition on each machine. By default, they are just
          placed in the log directory. If you place your log directory on
          a network filesystem partition, you should specify a local
          partition for the lock files with the 'LOCK' parameter in the
          config file (such as /var/lock/condor).
          
   Generally speaking, we recommend that you do not put these directories
   (except lock) on the same partition as /var, since if the partition
   fills up, you will fill up /var as well, which will cause lots of
   problems for your machines. Ideally, you'd have a separate partition
   for the Condor directories that the only consequence of filling up
   would be Condor's malfunction, not your whole machine.

   Config Files
          There are a number of config files that allow you different
          levels of control over how Condor is configured at each machine
          in your pool. In general, you will have 1 global configuration
          file for each platform. In addition, there is a local config
          file for each machine, where you can override settings in the
          global file. This allows you to have different daemons running,
          different policies for when to start and stop Condor jobs, and
          so on. In addition, because we recommend that you start the
          Condor daemons as root, we allow you to create config files
          that are owned and controlled by root that will override any
          other condor settings. This way, if the condor administrator
          isn't root, the regular condor config files can be owned and
          writable by condor-admin, but root doesn't have to grant root
          access to this person. See section 3.8.3 
          in the manual for a detailed discussion of the root config
          files, if you should use them, and what settings should be in
          them.
          
          In general, there are a number of places that condor will look
          to find its config files. The first file it looks for is the
          global config file. These locations are searched in order until
          a config file is found. If none contain a valid config file,
          Condor will print an error message and exit:
          
        1.
               File specified in CONDOR_CONFIG environment variable
        2.
               /etc/condor/condor_config
        3.
               ~condor/condor_config
               
          Next, Condor tries to load the machine-specific, or local
          config file. The only way to specify the local config file is
          in the global config file, with the LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE macro. If
          that macro isn't set, no local config file is used.
          
          The root config files come in last. The global file is searched
          for in the following places:
          
        1.
               File specified in CONDOR_CONFIG_ROOT environment variable
        2.
               /etc/condor/condor_config.root
        3.
               ~condor/condor_config.root
               
          The local root config file is found with the
          LOCAL_ROOT_CONFIG_FILE macro. If that isn't set, no local root
          config file is used.
          
   Release Directory
          Every binary distribution contains a 'release.tar' file that
          contains four subdirectories: 'bin', 'etc', 'lib' and 'sbin'.
          Wherever you choose to install these 4 directories we call the
          'release directory' (specified by the 'RELEASE_DIR' parameter
          in the config file). Each release directory contains platform
          dependent binaries and libraries, so you will need to install a
          separate one for each kind of machine in your pool.
          
          + User Binaries:
            All of the files in the 'bin' directory are programs the end
            Condor users should expect to have in their path. You could
            either put them in a well known location (such as
            /usr/local/condor/bin) which you have Condor users add to
            their PATH environment variable, or copy those files directly
            into a well known place already in user's PATHs (such as
            /usr/local/bin). With the above examples, you could also
            leave the binaries in /usr/local/condor/bin and put in soft
            links from /usr/local/bin to point to each program.
          + System Binaries:
            All of the files in the 'sbin' directory are Condor daemons
            and agents, or programs that only the Condor administrator
            would need to run. Therefore, we recommend that you only add
            these programs to the PATH of the Condor administrator.
          + Lib Directory:
            The files in the 'lib' directory are the condor libraries
            that must be linked in with user jobs for all of Condor's
            checkpointing and migration features to be used. 'lib' also
            contains scripts used by the condor_compile program to help
            relink jobs with the condor libraries. These files should be
            placed in a location that is world-readable, but they do not
            need to be placed in anyone's PATH. The condor_compile script
            checks the config file for the location of the lib directory.
          + Etc Directory:
            'etc' contains an 'examples' subdirectory which holds various
            example config files and other files used for installing
            Condor. 'etc' is the recommended location to keep the master
            copy of your config files. You can put in soft links from one
            of the places mentioned above that Condor checks
            automatically to find it's global config file.
            
   Documentation
          The documentation provided with Condor is currently only
          available in HTML, Postscript and PDF (Adobe Acrobat). It can
          be locally installed wherever is customary at your site. You
          can also find the Condor documentation on the web at:
          http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual.
          
  Am I using AFS?
  
   If you are using AFS at your site, be sure to read the
   section 3.7.1 in the manual. Condor does not
   currently have a way to authenticate itself to AFS. We're working on a
   solution, it's just not ready for version 6.0. So, what this means is
   that you are probably not going to want to have the LOCAL_DIR for
   Condor on AFS. However, you can (and probably should) have the Condor
   RELEASE_DIR on AFS, so that you can share one copy of those files and
   upgrade them in a centralized location. You will also have to do
   something special if you submit jobs to Condor from a directory on
   AFS. Again, read manual section 3.7.1 for all the gory details.
   
  Do I have enough disk space for Condor?
  
   The Condor release directory takes up a fair amount of space. This is
   another reason why it's a good idea to have it on a shared filesystem.
   The rough size requirements for the release directory on various
   platforms are listed in table 3.1.
   
                                      
                                      
   Table 3.1:  Release Directory Size Requirements
   
   Platform Size
   Intel/Linux          11 megs (statically linked)
   Intel/Linux          6.5 megs (dynamically linked)
   Intel/Solaris        8 megs
   Sparc/Solaris        10 megs
   SGI/IRIX             17.5 megs
   Alpha/Digital Unix   15.5 megs
   
   In addition, you will need a lot of disk space in the local directory
   of any machines that are submitting jobs to Condor. See question 5
   above for details on this.
   
3.2.2 Installation Procedure

     IF YOU HAVE DECIDED TO CREATE A 'condor' USER AND GROUP, YOU SHOULD
   DO THAT ON ALL YOUR MACHINES BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE.
   
   The easiest way to install Condor is to use one or both of the scripts
   provided to help you: condor_install and condor_init. You should run
   these scripts as the user that you are going to run the Condor daemons
   as. First, run condor_install on the machine that will be a fileserver
   for shared files used by Condor, such as the release directory, and
   possibly the condor user's home directory. When you do, choose the
   ``full-install'' option in step #1 described below.
   
   Once you have run condor_install on a file server to setup your
   release directory and configure Condor for your site, you should run
   condor_init on any other machines in your pool to create any locally
   used files that aren't created by condor_install. In the most simple
   case, where nearly all of Condor is installed on a shared file system,
   even though Condorinstall will create nearly all the files and
   directories you need, you will still need to use condor_init to create
   the LOCK directory on the local disk of each machine. If you have a
   shared release directory, but the LOCAL_DIR is local on each machine,
   condor_init will create all the directories and files needed in
   LOCAL_DIR. In addition, condor_init will create any soft links on each
   machine that are needed so that Condor can find its global config
   file.
   
   If you don't have a shared filesystem, you will need to run
   condor_install on each machine in your pool to setup Condor. In this
   case, there is no need to run condor_init at all.
   
   In addition, you will want to run condor_install on your central
   manager machine if that machine is different from your file server,
   using the ``central-manager'' option in step #1 described below. Run
   condor_install on your file server first, then on your central
   manager. If this step fails for some reason (NFS permissions, etc),
   you can do it manually quite easily. All this does is copy the
   condor_config.local.central.manager file from
   <release_dir>/etc/examples to the proper location for the local config
   file of your central manager machine. If your central manager is an
   Alpha or an SGI, you might want to add ``KBDD'' to the DAEMON_LIST
   parameter. See section 3.3 ``Configuring Condor'' 
   of the manual for details.
   
   condor_install assumes you have perl installed in /usr/bin/perl. If
   this is not the case, you can either edit the script to put the right
   path in, or you will have to invoke perl directly from your shell
   (assuming perl is in your PATH):

          % perl condor_install

   condor_install breaks down the installation procedure into various
   steps. Each step is clearly numbered. The following section explains
   what each step is for, and suggests how to answer the questions
   condor_install will ask you for each one.
   
  condor_install, step-by-step
  
   STEP 1: What type of Condor installation do you want?
          There are three types of Condor installation you might choose:
          'submit-only', 'full-install', and 'central-manager'. A
          submit-only machine can submit jobs to a Condor pool, but
          Condor jobs will not run on it. A full-install machine can both
          submit and run Condor jobs.
          
          If you are planning to run Condor jobs on your machines, you
          should either install and run Condor as root, or as user
          'condor'.
          
          If you are planning to setup a submit only machine, you can
          either install Condor machine-wide as root or user 'condor',
          or, you can install Condor as yourself into your home
          directory.
          
          The other possible installation type is setting up a machine as
          a central manager. If you do a full-install and you say that
          you want the local host to be your central manager, this step
          will be done automatically. You should only choose the
          central-manager option at step 1 if you have already run
          condor_install on your file server and you now want to run
          condor_install on a different machine that will be your central
          manager.
          
   STEP 2: How many machines are you setting up this way?
          If you are installing Condor for multiple machines, and you
          have a shared file system, condor_install will prompt you for
          the hostnames of each machine you want to add to your Condor
          pool. If you don't have a shared file system, you will have to
          run condor_install locally on each machine, anyway, so it
          doesn't bother asking you for the names. If you provide a list,
          it will use the names to automatically create directories and
          files later. At the end, condor_install will dump out this list
          to a 'roster' file which can be used by scripts to help
          maintain your Condor pool.
          
          If you are only installing Condor on 1 machine, you would just
          answer 'no' to the first question, and move on.
          
   STEP 3: Install the Condor release directory
          The release directory contains four subdirectories: 'bin',
          'etc', 'lib' and 'sbin'. bin contains user-level executable
          programs. etc is the recommended location for your Condor
          config files, and also includes an 'examples' directory with
          default config files and other default files used for
          installing condor. lib contains libraries to link condor user
          programs and scripts used by the Condor system. sbin contains
          all administrative executable programs and the Condor daemons.
          
          If you have multiple machines with a shared filesystem that
          will be running Condor, you should put the release directory on
          that shared filesystem so you only have one copy of all the
          binaries, and so that when you update them, you can do so in
          one place. Note that the release directory is architecture
          dependent, so you will need to download separate binary
          distributions for every platform in your pool.
          
          condor_install tries to find an already installed release
          directory. If it can't find one, it asks if you have installed
          one already. If you have not installed one, it tries to do so
          for you by untarring the release.tar file from the binary
          distribution.
          
          NOTE: If you are only setting up a central manager (you chose
          'central manager' in step 1) step 3 is the last question you
          will need to answer.
          
   STEP 4: How and where should Condor send email if things go wrong?
          Various parts of Condor will send email to a condor
          administrator if something goes wrong that needs human
          attention. You will need to specify the email address of this
          administrator.
          
          You will also need to specify the full path to a mail program
          that Condor will use to send the email. This program needs to
          understand the '-s' option, which is how you specify a subject
          for the outgoing message. The default on most platforms will
          probably be correct. On Linux machines, since there is such
          variation in Linux distributions and installations, you should
          verify that the default works. If the script complains that it
          cannot find the mail program that was specified, you can try
          'which mail' from your shell prompt to see what 'mail' program
          is currently in your PATH. If there is none, try 'which mailx'.
          If you still can't find anything, ask your system
          administrator. You should verify that the program you end up
          using supports '-s'. The man page for that program will
          probably tell you.
          
   STEP 5: Filesystem and UID domains.
          While Condor does not depend on a shared filesystem or common
          UID space for running standard jobs, if you intend to run
          vanilla jobs (ones that aren't relinked with the Condor
          libaries), you need a shared filesystem and a common UID space.
          Therefore, it is very important for you to correctly configure
          Condor to tell it about a shared filesystem if you have one.
          For complete details on what these settings do and how you
          should answer the questions, be sure to read section 3.4.5,
          ``Shared Filesystem Config File Entries'', on page  [*] .
          
          You will be asked if you have a shared filesystem. If so,
          condor_install will configure your FILESYSTEM_DOMAIN setting to
          be set to the domainname of the machine running condor_install.
          If not, FILESYSTEM_DOMAIN will be set to $(FULL_HOSTNAME),
          indicating that each machine is in its own domain.
          
          For the UID domain, Condor needs to know if all users across
          all the machines in your pool have a unique UID. If so,
          UID_DOMAIN will be set to the domainname of the machine running
          condor_install. If not, UID_DOMAIN will be set to
          MacroUFULL_HOSTNAME, indicating that each machine is in its own
          domain.
          
          If you have a common UID_DOMAIN, condor_install will ask you if
          have a soft UID domain , meaning that although you have unique
          UIDs, not every machine in your pool has all the users in their
          individual password files. Please see the description of
          SOFT_UID_DOMAIN in section 3.4.5 on page  [*] for details.
          
   STEP 6: Where should public programs be installed?
          It is recommended that you install the user-level condor
          programs in the release directory, (where they go by default).
          This way, when you want to install a new version of the Condor
          binaries, you can just replace your release directory and
          everything will be updated at once. So, one option is to have
          Condor users add <release_dir>/bin to their PATH, so that they
          can access the programs. However, we recommend putting in soft
          links from some directory already in their PATH (such as
          /usr/local/bin) that point back to the Condor user programs.
          condor_install will do this for you, all you have to do is tell
          it what directory to put these links into. This way, users
          don't have to change their PATH to use Condor but you can still
          have the binaries installed in their own location.
          
          If you are installing Condor as neither root nor condor, there
          is a perl script wrapper to all the Condor tools that is
          created which sets some appropriate environment variables and
          automatically passes certain options to the tools. This is all
          created automatically by condor_install. So, you need to tell
          condor_install where to put this perl script. The script itself
          is linked to itself with many different names, since it is the
          name that determines the behavior of the script. This script
          should go somewhere that is in your PATH already, if possible
          (such as ~bin).
          
   At this point, the remaining steps are different depending on what
   kind of installation you are doing. Skip to the appropriate section
   depending on what kind of installation you selected in STEP 1 above.
   
  Full Install
  
   STEP 7: What machine will be your central manager?
          Simply type in the full hostname of the machine you have chosen
          for your central manager. If condor_install can't find
          information about the host you typed by querying your
          nameserver, it will print out an error message and ask you to
          confirm.
          
   STEP 8: Where will the 'local directory' go?
          This is the directory discussed in question #5 from the
          introduction. condor_install tries to make some educated
          guesses as to what directory you want to use for the purpose.
          Simply agree to the correct guess, or (when condor_install has
          run out of guesses) type in what you want. Since this directory
          needs to be unique, it is common to use the hostname of each
          machine in its name. When typing in your own path, you can use
          '$(HOSTNAME)' which condor_install (and the Condor config
          files) will expand to the hostname of the machine you are
          currently on. condor_install will try to create the
          corresponding directories for all the machines you told it
          about in STEP 2 above.
          
          Once you have selected the local directory, condor_install
          creates all the needed subdirectories of each one with the
          proper permissions. They should have the following permissions
          and ownerships:
          
     drwxr-xr-x   2 condor   root         1024 Mar  6 01:30 execute/
     drwxr-xr-x   2 condor   root         1024 Mar  6 01:30 log/
     drwxr-xr-x   2 condor   root         1024 Mar  6 01:30 spool/

          If your local directory is on a shared file system,
          condor_install will prompt you for the location of your lock
          files, as discussed in question #5 above. In this case, when
          condor_install is finished, you will have to run condor_init on
          each machine in your pool to create the lock directory before
          you can start up Condor.
          
   STEP 9: Where will the local (machine-specific) config files go?
          As discussed in question #6 above, there are a few different
          levels of Condor config file. There's the global config file
          that will be installed in <release_dir>/etc/condor_config, and
          there are machine-specific, or local config files that override
          the settings in the global file. If you are installing on
          multiple machines or are configuring your central manager
          machine, you must select a location for your local config
          files.
          
          The two main options are to have a single directory that holds
          all the local config files, each one named '$(HOSTNAME).local',
          or to have the local config files go into the individual local
          directories for each machine. Given a shared filesystem, we
          recommend the first option, since it makes it easier to
          configure your pool from a centralized location.
          
   STEP 10: How do you want Condor to find its config file?
          Since there are a few known places Condor looks to find your
          config file, we recommend that you put a soft link from one of
          them to point to <release_dir>/etc/condor_config. This way, you
          can keep your Condor configuration in a centralized location,
          but all the Condor daemons and tools will be able to find their
          config files. Alternatively, you can set the CONDOR_CONFIG
          environment variable to contain
          <release_dir>/etc/condor_config.
          
          condor_install will ask you if you want to create a soft link
          from either of the two fixed locations that Condor searches.
          
   Once you have completed STEP 10, you're done. condor_install prints out
   a messages describing what to do next. Please skip to
   section 3.2.3 below.

               This section has not yet been written
                                      
3.2.3 Condor is installed... now what?

     Now that Condor has been installed on your machine(s), there are a
   few things you should check before you start up Condor.
   
   1.
          Read through the <release_dir>/etc/condor_config file. There
          are a lot of possible settings and you should at least take a
          look at the first two main sections to make sure everything
          looks okay. In particular, you might want to setup host/ip
          based security for Condor. See the section 3.6 
          in the manual to learn how to do this.
   2.
          Condor can monitor the activity of your mouse and keyboard,
          provided that you tell it where to look. You do this with the
          CONSOLE_DEVICES entry in the condor_startd section of the
          config file. On most platforms, we provide reasonable defaults.
          For example, the default device for the mouse on Linux is
          'mouse', since most Linux installations have a soft link from
          '/dev/mouse' that points to the right device (such as tty00 if
          you have a serial mouse, psaux if you have a PS/2 bus mouse,
          etc). If you don't have a /dev/mouse link, you should either
          create one (you'll be glad you did), or change the
          CONSOLE_DEVICES entry in Condor's config file. This entry is
          just a comma seperated list, so you can have any devices in
          /dev count as 'console devices' and activity will be reported
          in the condor_startd's classad as ConsoleIdleTime.
   3.
          (Linux only) Condor needs to be able to find the 'utmp' file.
          According to the Linux File System Standard, this file should
          be /var/run/utmp. If Condor can't find it there, it looks in
          /var/adm/utmp. If it still can't find it, it gives up. So, if
          your Linux distribution puts this file somewhere else, be sure
          to put a soft link from /var/run/utmp to point to the real
          location.
   4.
          (HPUX 10 and Solaris machines only) Set the ARCH parameter in
          the condor_config file. On HPUX 10 and Solaris machines, there
          are multiple CPU architectures that your machine could be
          using. Our Condor programs are binary compatible across these
          platforms. Therefore, you only need one release directory for
          each OS. However, Condor jobs can NOT checkpoint on one
          architecture and restart on a different one. So, you have to
          specify which architecture you have on each of your machines to
          prevent Condor from trying to migrate jobs between them. If all
          of your machines are the same architecture you don't really
          need to worry about this, but you might as well set the
          parameter correctly in case you add machines later. You can
          just edit the site-wide condor_config file in
          <release_dir>/etc/condor_config. In the 'things you may want to
          customize section', you will see entries for ARCH and OPSYS.
          Uncomment the proper ARCH for your machines. If you have some
          machines of each kind in your pool, set the one in the
          site-wide config file to be the architecture you have the most
          of, and for machines of the other kind, put an ARCH line in the
          the local config file for the proper architecture.
          
3.2.4 Starting up the Condor daemons

   To start up the Condor daemons, all you need to do is execute
   <release_dir>/sbin/condor_master. This is the Condor master, whose
   only job in life is to make sure the other Condor daemons are running.
   The master keeps track of the daemons, restarts them if they crash,
   and periodically checks to see if you have installed new binaries (and
   if so, restarts the affected daemons).
   
   If you're setting up your own pool, you should start Condor on your
   central manager machine first. If you have done a submit-only
   installation and are adding machines to an existing pool, it doesn't
   matter what order to start them in.
   
   To ensure that Condor is running, you can run either:
        ps -ef | egrep condor_

   or
        ps -aux | egrep condor_

   depending on your flavor of Unix. On your central manager machine you
   should have processes for:
     * condor_master
     * condor_collector
     * condor_negotiator
     * condor_startd
     * condor_schedd
       
   On all other machines in your pool you should have processes for:
     * condor_master
     * condor_startd
     * condor_schedd
       
   (NOTE: On Alphas and IRIX machines, there will also be a 'condor_kbdd'
   - see section 3.7.3 of the manual for details.)
   If you have setup a submit-only machine, you will only see:
     * condor_master
     * condor_schedd
       
   Once you're sure the Condor daemons are running, check to make sure
   that they are communicating with each other. You can run condor_status
   to get a one line summary of the status of each machine in your pool.
   
   Once you're sure Condor is working properly, you should add
   ``condor_master" into your startup/bootup scripts (i.e. /etc/rc ) so
   that your machine runs condor_master upon bootup. condor_master will
   then fire up the neccesary Condor daemons whenever your machine is
   rebooted.
   
   If your system uses System-V style init scripts, you can look in
   <release_dir>/etc/examples/condor.boot for a script that can be used
   to start and stop Condor automatically by init. Normally, you would
   install this script as /etc/init.d/condor and put in soft link from
   various directories (for example, /etc/rc2.d) that point back to
   /etc/init.d/condor. The exact location of these scripts and links will
   vary on different platforms.
   
   If your system uses BSD style boot scripts, you probably have an
   /etc/rc.local file. Just add a line in there to start up
   <release_dir>/sbin/condor_master and you're done.
   
3.2.5 The Condor daemons are running... now what?

   Now that the Condor daemons are running, there are a few things you
   can and should do:
   
   1.
          (Optional) Do a full install for the condor_compile script.
          condor_compile assists in linking jobs with the Condor
          libraries to take advantage of all of Condor's features. As it
          is currently installed, it will work by placing it in front of
          any of the following commands that you would normally use to
          link your code: gcc, g++, g77, cc, acc, c89, CC, f77, fort77
          and ld. If you complete the full install, you will be able to
          use condor_compile with any command whatsoever, in particular,
          make. See section 3.7.2 in the manual for directions.
   2.
          Try building and submitting some test jobs. See examples/README
          for details.
   3.
          If your site uses the AFS network file system, see
          section 3.7.1 in the manual.
   4.
          We strongly recommend that you start up Condor (i.e. run the
          condor_master daemon) as user root. If you must start Condor as
          some user other than root, see section 3.8.1.
