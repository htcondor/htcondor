#
# If a plug-in fails partway through uploading a checkpoint, it doesn't
# necessarily delete the partial upload, so HTCondor has to track all
# upload attempts, and delete those which fail.
#
# We therefore need to test:
#   1.  That the shadow cleans up after an upload failure.
#   2.  That condor_preen cleans up after an upload failure, in case the
#       the shadow didn't try to clean up (because it failed) or because
#       its attempt failed for some other reason.
#   3.  That deleting the failed attemt does not delete any other attempt.
#   4.  That the starter does not attempt to download any failed
#       checkpoint.
#   5.  That a failure to checkpoint does not increase CommittedTime.
#
# We assume that if the starter downloads only succesful checkpoints that
# the job resumes appropriately; this is explicitly test elsewhere.
#
# The upload failure cases should specifically include:
#   a.  The first attempt failing, then the rest succeeding.
#   b.  The second attempt failing, and the rest succeeding.
#   c.  Alternate attempts succeeding and failing.
#   d.  All attempts failing.  (All attempts succeeding is checked
#       in other tests.)
#   e.  Alternate attempts suceeding and failing in pairs.
#
# Test (1) and (2) are mutually exclusive, but (3), (4), and (5) should
# be checked in both cases.  However, since (1) and (2) are mutually
# exclusive, we can just examine the state of the disk after the job
# completes to determine if they did the right thing.
#
# It would be easiest to implement (1) and (2) as different HTCondor
# configurations, implying that test cases (a) - (e) could otherwise
# be shared.  (They should be executed concurrently, unless (3) - (5)
# imply otherwise.)  In both (1) and (2), it would be easiest to
# submit the job with `on_exit_remove = false`, so that the schedd
# doesn't try to clean up when the job exits the queue.  (It should
# be possible to configure the schedd to run a useless clean-up
# script instead, but it seems easier to not run it at all.)
#
#   * Let's ignore (3) for now; it's wrong to delete _all_ failed checkpoints
#     only for performance reasons.  If that becomes a problem, we can
#     write a test static test for this later (that is, construct a fake set
#     of MANIFEST and FAILURE files in the right place, run the clean-up
#     script and see what's left).
#   * We should be able to check (4) after the fact by looking at the
#     transfer log.  (The URLs will all be distinct.)
#     Test (4) doesn't actually make sense if we've passed test (1),
#     so we could skip it in the shadow tests, but it won't hurt to
#     double-check, and if (1) fails but (4) succeeds, that probably
#     means we have an interesting problem....
#   * We should be able to check (5) by looking at the epoch log, because
#     all jobs evict themselves after their first upload failure.  For
#     simplicity, we'll only look at the test cases whose first checkpoint
#     fails, because then we know the CommittedTime should be 0.
