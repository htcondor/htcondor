job_dagman_splice-A.run

testA:
    Test interpolating of the $(JOB) variable in to the right hand side of
    a VARS variable for the job's submit file.

testB:
    Test inclusion of multiple splices in one dag file (which has
    jobs and parent/child relationships between the jobs) with no
    PARENT/CHILD relationships between the splices and anything else. The
    result should be each splice is treated as a disjoint graph in
    the entire dag.

testC:
    Test using a splice as a child of a regular JOB.

testD:
    Test using a splice as a parent of a regular JOB.

testE:
    Test using a JOB as a child and parent of a splice.

testF:
    Test using a splice as a child and parent of a regular JOB.

testG:
    Test using a splice as a parent of another splice.
    This also tests using a splice as a child of a splice.

testH:
    Splices which include themselves and have no parent/child relationships
    between them should all appear as disjoint graphs in the entire dag.

testI:
    If a splice has disjoint graphs, then make sure all the initial and
    final nodes are treated properly when the splice is used as a parent/child
    in a dependancy.

testJ:
    Run condor_submit_dag with multiple dag files each bringing
    in a splice.  Each main dag file (after splicing is resolved)
    should be a disjoint graph to the other dag files. This tests to see
    if the jobnames and splice names had been "munged" correctly.

testK:
    This was a dag geometry I stumbled across which flushed out a bug in
    the prefixing of nodes and the reconstruction of the node name
    index hash table. It had to do with the specific splice names
    (S2 being used legally twice) and the bug in my code.

		by pids. After the job completes, the test looks for all of those
		processes being properly cleaned up. These child processes run
		forever if not cleaned up. An all inclusive PS is processed
		for processes still running. The job waits around 60 seconds to
		allow a snapshot to be captured.
