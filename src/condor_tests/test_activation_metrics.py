#
# See HTCONDOR-861 for a detailed description of the metrics and the job
# lifecycle they assume.
#
# For testing purposes, we verify that:
#
# (a) all four activation metric values appear in the job ad
# (b) ActivationDuration >= Activation[SetUp + Execution + Teardown]Duration
# (c) ActivationDuration is less than the shadow lifetime, which is
#     approximately CompletionDate - JobStartDate.
#
# Conditions (b) and (c) are consistency conditions.  These tests don't
# attempt to verify the correctness of the durations in question because
# the durations will vary depending on the load on machine running the
# tests, and trying to compensate for that could be quickly become very
# complicated (see the custom machine resource(s) tests) and very slow
# (in order to always generate timings that are larger than the variances).
#
# However, we would also like to verify that the code notices when a
# self-checkpointing job checkpoints and restarts.  Because the execution
# duration is only updated at exit time [at least for now], we can check
# this by verifying that the execution duration changes during a self-
# checkpointing job (whose checkpoint interval varies).  As a further
# consistency check, we should verify that the ActivationDuration is
# larger than the sum of the two different execution durations that we see.
