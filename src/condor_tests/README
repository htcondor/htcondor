The README files in this directory will help you figure out what's
going on and to understand where and how to add new tests to the test
suite.  For maximum clarity, these files should be read in the
following order:

README.filenames    Describes the filename convention in place
README.imake        Describes the Imake rules and files in use
README.testclass    Describes how and why tests can be categorized
README.running      Describes how to run tests in the test suite

The WISDOM.* files are specific wisdom about various languages, tests,
etc, and is not particularly current or accurate...
