The README files in this directory will help you figure out what's
going on and to understand where and how to add new tests to the test
suite.  For maximum clarity, these files should be read in the
following order:

README.filenames        Describes the filename convention in place
README.imake            Describes the Imake rules and files in use
README.testclass        Describes how and why tests can be categorized
README.running          Describes how to run tests in the test suite
README.personal_condor  Describes how to wrap a test in a personal condor
README.checks           Description of check modules

The WISDOM.* files are specific wisdom about various languages, tests,
