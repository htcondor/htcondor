##  condor_config
##
##  This is the global configuration file for condor.
##
##  The file is divided into four main parts:
##  Part 1:  Settings you MUST customize 
##  Part 2:  Settings you may want to customize
##  Part 3:  Settings that control the policy of when condor will
##           start and stop jobs on your machines
##  Part 4:  Settings you should probably leave alone (unless you
##  know what you're doing)
##
##  Please read the INSTALL file (or the Install chapter in the
##  Condor Administrator's Manual) for detailed explanations of the 
##  various settings in here and possible ways to configure your
##  pool. 
##
##  If you are installing Condor as root and then handing over the
##  administration of this file to a person you do not trust with
##  root access, please read the Installation chapter paying careful
##  note to the condor_config.root entries.
##
##  Unless otherwise specified, settings that are commented out show
##  the defaults that are used if you don't define a value.  Settings
##  that are defined here MUST BE DEFINED since they have no default
##  value.
##
##  Unless otherwise indicated, all settings which specify a time are
##  defined in seconds.

##  Flocking: Submitting jobs to more than one pool
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Flocking allows you to run your jobs in other pools, or lets
##  others run jobs in your pool.
## 
##  To let others flock to you, define FLOCK_FROM.
## 
##  To flock to others, define FLOCK_TO.

##  FLOCK_FROM defines the machines where you would like to grant
##  people access to your pool via flocking. (i.e. you are granting
##  access to these machines to join your pool).
FLOCK_FROM = 
##  An example of this is:
#FLOCK_FROM = somehost.friendly.domain, anotherhost.friendly.domain

##  FLOCK_TO defines the central managers of the pools that you want
##  to flock to. (i.e. you are specifying the machines that you
##  want your jobs to be negotiated at -- thereby specifying the
##  pools they will run in.)
FLOCK_TO = 
##  An example of this is:
#FLOCK_TO = central_manager.friendly.domain, condor.cs.wisc.edu

##  FLOCK_COLLECTOR_HOSTS should almost always be the same as
##  FLOCK_NEGOTIATOR_HOSTS (as shown below).  The only reason it would be
##  different is if the collector and negotiator in the pool that you are
##  flocking too are running on different machines (not recommended).
##  The collectors must be specified in the same corresponding order as
##  the FLOCK_NEGOTIATOR_HOSTS list.
FLOCK_NEGOTIATOR_HOSTS = $(FLOCK_TO)
FLOCK_COLLECTOR_HOSTS = $(FLOCK_TO)
## An example of having the negotiator and the collector on different
## machines is:
#FLOCK_NEGOTIATOR_HOSTS = condor.cs.wisc.edu, condor-negotiator.friendly.domain
#FLOCK_COLLECTOR_HOSTS =  condor.cs.wisc.edu, condor-collector.friendly.domain

##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Host/IP access levels
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Please see the administrator's manual for details on these
##  settings, what they're for, and how to use them.

##  What machines have administrative rights for your pool?  This
##  defaults to your central manager.  You should set it to the
##  machine(s) where whoever is the condor administrator(s) works
##  (assuming you trust all the users who log into that/those
##  machine(s), since this is machine-wide access you're granting).
ALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR = $(CONDOR_HOST)

##  If there are no machines that should have administrative access 
##  to your pool (for example, there's no machine where only trusted
##  users have accounts), you can uncomment this setting.
##  Unfortunately, this will mean that administering your pool will 
##  be more difficult.
#DENY_ADMINISTRATOR = *

##  What machines should have "owner" access to your machines, meaning
##  they can issue commands that a machine owner should be able to
##  issue to their own machine (like condor_vacate).  This defaults to
##  machines with administrator access, and the local machine.  This
##  is probably what you want.
ALLOW_OWNER = $(FULL_HOSTNAME), $(ALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR)

##  Read access.  Machines listed as allow (and/or not listed as deny)
##  can view the status of your pool, but cannot join your pool 
##  or run jobs.
##  NOTE: By default, without these entries customized, you
##  are granting read access to the whole world.  You may want to
##  restrict that to hosts in your domain.  If possible, please also
##  grant read access to "*.cs.wisc.edu", so the Condor developers
##  will be able to view the status of your pool and more easily help
##  you install, configure or debug your Condor installation.
##  It is important to have this defined.
ALLOW_READ = * 
#ALLOW_READ = *.your.domain, *.cs.wisc.edu
#DENY_READ = *.bad.subnet, bad-machine.your.domain, 144.77.88.*

##  Write access.  Machines listed here can join your pool, submit
##  jobs, etc.  Note: Any machine which has WRITE access must
##  also be granted READ access.  Granting WRITE access below does
##  not also automatically grant READ access; you must change
##  ALLOW_READ above as well.
##  If you leave it as it is, it will be unspecified, and effectively
##  it will be allowing anyone to write to your pool.
ALLOW_WRITE = *
#ALLOW_WRITE = *.your.domain, your-friend's-machine.other.domain
#DENY_WRITE = bad-machine.your.domain

##  Negotiator access.  Machines listed here are trusted central
##  managers.  You should normally not have to change this.
ALLOW_NEGOTIATOR = $(NEGOTIATOR_HOST)
##  Now, with flocking we need to let the SCHEDD trust the other 
##  negotiators we are flocking with as well.  You should normally 
##  not have to change this either.
ALLOW_NEGOTIATOR_SCHEDD = $(NEGOTIATOR_HOST), $(FLOCK_NEGOTIATOR_HOSTS)

##  Config access.  Machines listed here can use the condor_config_val
##  tool to modify all daemon configurations except those specified in
##  the condor_config.root file.  This level of host-wide access
##  should only be granted with extreme caution.  By default, config
##  access is denied from all hosts.
#ALLOW_CONFIG = trusted-host.your.domain

##  Flocking Configs.  These are the real things that Condor looks at,
##  but we set them from the FLOCK_FROM/TO macros above.  It is safe
##  to leave these unchanged.
ALLOW_WRITE_COLLECTOR = $(ALLOW_WRITE), $(FLOCK_FROM)
ALLOW_WRITE_STARTD    = $(ALLOW_WRITE), $(FLOCK_FROM)
ALLOW_READ_COLLECTOR  = $(ALLOW_READ), $(FLOCK_FROM)
ALLOW_READ_STARTD     = $(ALLOW_READ), $(FLOCK_FROM)

##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Security parameters for setting configuration values remotely:
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  These parameters define the list of attributes that can be set
##  remotely with condor_config_val for the security access levels
##  defined above (for example, WRITE, ADMINISTRATOR, CONFIG, etc).
##  Please see the administrator's manual for futher details on these
##  settings, what they're for, and how to use them.  There are no
##  default values for any of these settings.  If they are not
##  defined, no attributes can be set with condor_config_val.

##  Attributes that can be set by hosts with "CONFIG" permission (as
##  defined with ALLOW_CONFIG and DENY_CONFIG above).
##  The commented-out value here was the default behavior of Condor
##  prior to version 6.3.3.  If you don't need this behavior, you
##  should leave this commented out.
#SETTABLE_ATTRS_CONFIG = *

##  Attributes that can be set by hosts with "ADMINISTRATOR"
##  permission (as defined above)
#SETTABLE_ATTRS_ADMINISTRATOR = *_DEBUG, MAX_*_LOG

##  Attributes that can be set by hosts with "OWNER" permission (as
##  defined above) NOTE: any Condor job running on a given host will
##  have OWNER permission on that host by default.  If you grant this
##  kind of access, Condor jobs will be able to modify any attributes
##  you list below on the machine where they are running.  This has
##  obvious security implications, so only grant this kind of
##  permission for custom attributes that you define for your own use
##  at your pool (custom attributes about your machines that are
##  published with the STARTD_EXPRS setting, for example).
#SETTABLE_ATTRS_OWNER = your_custom_attribute, another_custom_attr

##  You can also define daemon-specific versions of each of these
##  settings.  For example, to define settings that can only be
##  changed in the condor_startd's configuration by hosts with OWNER
##  permission, you would use:
#STARTD_SETTABLE_ATTRS_OWNER = your_custom_attribute_name

##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Network filesystem parameters:
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Do you want to use NFS for file access instead of remote system
##  calls?
#USE_NFS		= False

##  Do you want to use AFS for file access instead of remote system
##  calls?
#USE_AFS		= False

##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Checkpoint server:
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Do you want to use a checkpoint server if one is available?  If a
##  checkpoint server isn't available or USE_CKPT_SERVER is set to
##  False, checkpoints will be written to the local SPOOL directory on
##  the submission machine.
#USE_CKPT_SERVER	= True

##  What's the hostname of this machine's nearest checkpoint server?
#CKPT_SERVER_HOST	= checkpoint-server-hostname.your.domain

##  Do you want the starter on the execute machine to choose the
##  checkpoint server?  If False, the CKPT_SERVER_HOST set on
##  the submit machine is used.  Otherwise, the CKPT_SERVER_HOST set
##  on the execute machine is used.  The default is true.
#STARTER_CHOOSES_CKPT_SERVER = True

##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Miscellaneous:
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Try to save this much swap space by not starting new shadows.  
##  Specified in megabytes.
#RESERVED_SWAP		= 5

##  What's the maximum number of jobs you want a single submit machine
##  to spawn shadows for?
#MAX_JOBS_RUNNING	= 200

##  Condor needs to create a few lock files to synchronize access to
##  various log files.  Because of problems we've had with network
##  filesystems and file locking over the years, we HIGHLY recommend
##  that you put these lock files on a local partition on each
##  machine.  If you don't have your LOCAL_DIR on a local partition,
##  be sure to change this entry.  Whatever user (or group) condor is
##  running as needs to have write access to this directory.  If
##  you're not running as root, this is whatever user you started up
##  the condor_master as.  If you are running as root, and there's a
##  condor account, it's probably condor.  Otherwise, it's whatever
##  you've set in the CONDOR_IDS environment variable.  See the Admin
##  manual for details on this.
LOCK		= $(LOG)

##  If you don't use a fully qualified name in your /etc/hosts file
##  (or NIS, etc.) for either your official hostname or as an alias,
##  Condor wouldn't normally be able to use fully qualified names in
##  places that it'd like to.  You can set this parameter to the
##  domain you'd like appended to your hostname, if changing your host
##  information isn't a good option.  This parameter must be set in
##  the global config file (not the LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE from above). 
#DEFAULT_DOMAIN_NAME = your.domain.name

##  Condor can be told whether or not you want the Condor daemons to
##  create a core file if something really bad happens.  This just
##  sets the resource limit for the size of a core file.  By default,
##  we don't do anything, and leave in place whatever limit was in
##  effect when you started the Condor daemons.  If this parameter is
##  set and "True", we increase the limit to as large as it gets.  If
##  it's set to "False", we set the limit at 0 (which means that no
##  core files are even created).  Core files greatly help the Condor
##  developers debug any problems you might be having.
#CREATE_CORE_FILES	= True

##  If your site needs to use UID_DOMAIN settings (defined above) that
##  are not real Internet domains that match the hostnames, you can
##  tell Condor to trust whatever UID_DOMAIN a submit machine gives to
##  the execute machine and just make sure the two strings match.  The
##  default for this setting is False, since it is more secure this
##  way.
#TRUST_UID_DOMAIN = False

##  Settings that control the daemon's debugging output:

##  The rank expressions used by the negotiator are configured below.

##    2. rank in job ClassAd
##    3. NEGOTIATOR_POST_JOB_RANK
##    4. cause of preemption (0=user priority,1=startd rank,2=no preemption)
##    5. PREEMPTION_RANK

##  The NEGOTIATOR_PRE_JOB_RANK expression overrides all other ranks
##  that are used to pick a match from the set of possibilities.
##  The following expression matches jobs to unclaimed resources
##  whenever possible, regardless of the job-supplied rank.
UWCS_NEGOTIATOR_PRE_JOB_RANK = RemoteOwner =?= UNDEFINED

##  The NEGOTIATOR_POST_JOB_RANK expression chooses between
##  resources that are equally preferred by the job.
##  The following example expression steers jobs toward
##  faster machines and tends to fill a cluster of multi-processors
##  breadth-first instead of depth-first.  In this example,
##  the expression is chosen to have no effect when preemption
##  would take place, allowing control to pass on to
##  PREEMPTION_RANK.
#UWCS_NEGOTIATOR_POST_JOB_RANK = \
# (RemoteOwner =?= UNDEFINED) * (KFlops - VirtualMachineID)

##  The negotiator will not preempt a job running on a given machine
##  unless the PREEMPTION_REQUIREMENTS expression evaluates to true
##  and the owner of the idle job has a better priority than the owner
##  of the running job.  This expression defaults to true.
UWCS_PREEMPTION_REQUIREMENTS = $(StateTimer) > (1 * $(HOUR)) && RemoteUserPrio > SubmittorPrio * 1.2

##  The PREEMPTION_RANK expression is used in a case where preemption
##  is the only option and all other negotiation ranks are equal.  For
##  example, if the job has no preference, it is usually preferable to
##  preempt a job with a small ImageSize instead of a job with a large
##  ImageSize.  The default is to rank all preemptable matches the
##  same.  However, the negotiator will always prefer to match the job
##  with an idle machine over a preemptable machine, if all other
##  negotiation ranks are equal.
UWCS_PREEMPTION_RANK = (RemoteUserPrio * 1000000) - TARGET.ImageSize

##  In most cases, your condor_collector and condor_negotiator are 
##  going to run on the same machine.  If for some reason, this isn't 
##  the case, here's where you'd change it. Also, you can change the
##  port that the collector and negotiator run on. By default, the
##  collector uses port 9618 and the negotiator uses port 9614, but
##  you can set the port with a ":port", such as:

##  How much disk space would you like reserved from Condor?  In
##  places where Condor is computing the free disk space on various
##  partitions, it subtracts the amount it really finds by this
##  many megabytes.  (If undefined, defaults to 0).
RESERVED_DISK		= 5

##  If your machine is running AFS and the AFS cache lives on the same

##  By default, if a user does not specify "notify_user" in the submit
##  description file, any email Condor sends about that job will go to

##  domain (so that you would set UID_DOMAIN to be the same across all
##  machines in your pool), *BUT* email to user@UID_DOMAIN is *NOT*
##  the right place for Condor to send email for your site, you can
##  define the default domain to use for email.  A common example
##  would be to set EMAIL_DOMAIN to the fully qualified hostname of
##  each machine in your pool, so users submitting jobs from a
##  specific machine would get email sent to user@machine.your.domain,
##  instead of user@your.domain.  In general, you should leave this
##  setting commented out unless two things are true: 1) UID_DOMAIN is
##  set to your domain, not $(FULL_HOSTNAME), and 2) email to
##  user@UID_DOMAIN won't work.

##  If your site needs to use TCP updates to the collector, instead of
##  UDP, you can enable this feature.  HOWEVER, WE DO NOT RECOMMEND
##  THIS FOR MOST SITES!  In general, the only sites that might want
##  this feature are pools made up of machines connected via a
##  wide-area network where UDP packets are frequently or always
##  dropped.  If you enable this feature, you *MUST* turn on the
##  COLLECTOR_SOCKET_CACHE_SIZE setting at your collector, and each
##  entry in the socket cache uses another file descriptor.  If not
##  defined, this feature is disabled by default.
#UPDATE_COLLECTOR_WITH_TCP = True

## HIGHPORT and LOWPORT let you set the range of ports that Condor
## will use. This may be useful if you are behind a firewall. By
## default, Condor uses port 9618 for the collector, 9614 for the
## negotiator, and system-assigned (apparently random) ports for
## everything else. HIGHPORT and LOWPORT only affect these
## system-assigned ports, but will restrict them to the range you
## specify here. If you want to change the well-known ports for the
## collector or negotiator, see COLLECTOR_HOST or NEGOTIATOR_HOST.
## Note that both LOWPORT and HIGHPORT must be at least 1024. 
#HIGHPORT = 9700

#SHUTDOWN_FAST_TIMEOUT		= 120

######
##  Exponential backoff settings:
######
##  When a daemon keeps crashing, we use "exponential backoff" so we
##  wait longer and longer before restarting it.  This is the base of
##  the exponent used to determine how long to wait before starting
##  the daemon again:
#MASTER_BACKOFF_FACTOR		= 2.0

##  What's the maximum amount of time you want the master to wait
##  between attempts to start a given daemon?  (With 2.0 as the
##  MASTER_BACKOFF_FACTOR, you'd hit 1 hour in 12 restarts...)
#MASTER_BACKOFF_CEILING		= 3600

##  How long should a daemon run without crashing before we consider
##  it "recovered".  Once a daemon has recovered, we reset the number
##  of restarts so the exponential backoff stuff goes back to normal. 
#MASTER_RECOVER_FACTOR		= 300

##  Where are the various condor_starter binaries installed?
STARTER_LIST = STARTER, STARTER_STANDARD
STARTER			= $(SBIN)/condor_starter

##  When the startd starts up, it can place it's address (IP and port)
##  into a file.  This way, tools running on the local machine don't
##  need to query the central manager to find the startd.  This
##  feature can be turned off by commenting out this setting.
STARTD_ADDRESS_FILE	= $(LOG)/.startd_address

##  When a machine is claimed, how often should we poll the state of
##  the machine to see if we need to evict/suspend the job, etc?
#POLLING_INTERVAL        = 5

##  How often should the startd send updates to the central manager? 
#UPDATE_INTERVAL         = 300

##  How long is the startd willing to stay in the "matched" state?
#MATCH_TIMEOUT		= 300

##  How long is the startd willing to stay in the preempting/killing
##  state before it just kills the starter directly?
#KILLING_TIMEOUT	= 30

##  When a machine unclaimed, when should it run benchmarks?
##  LastBenchmark is initialized to 0, so this expression says as soon
##  as we're unclaimed, run the benchmarks.  Thereafter, if we're
##  unclaimed and it's been at least 4 hours since we ran the last
##  benchmarks, run them again.  The startd keeps a weighted average
##  of the benchmark results to provide more accurate values.
##  Note, if you don't want any benchmarks run at all, set RunBenchmarks to "False".
#RunBenchmarks = False
#RunBenchmarks = (time() - LastBenchmark) >= (4 * $(HOUR))

##  Normally, when the startd is computing the idle time of all the
##  users of the machine (both local and remote), it checks the utmp
##  file to find all the currently active ttys, and only checks access
##  time of the devices associated with active logins.  Unfortunately,
##  on some systems, utmp is unreliable, and the startd might miss
##  keyboard activity by doing this.  So, if your utmp is unreliable,
##  set this setting to True and the startd will check the access time
##  on all tty and pty devices.
#STARTD_HAS_BAD_UTMP = False

##  This entry allows the startd to monitor console (keyboard and
##  mouse) activity by checking the access times on special files in
##  /dev.  Activity on these files shows up as "ConsoleIdle" time in
##  the startd's ClassAd.  Just give a comma-separated list of the
##  names of devices you want considered the console, without the
##  "/dev/" portion of the pathname.
CONSOLE_DEVICES	= mouse, console

##  The STARTD_EXPRS entry allows you to have the startd advertise
##  arbitrary expressions from the config file in its ClassAd.  Give
##  the comma-separated list of entries from the config file you want
##  in the startd ClassAd.
##  Note: because of the different syntax of the config file and
##  ClassAds, you might have to do a little extra work to get a given
##  entry into the ClassAd.  In particular, ClassAds require "'s
##  around your strings.  Numeric values can go in directly, as can
##  boolean expressions.  For example, if you wanted the startd to
##  advertise its list of console devices, when it's configured to run
##  benchmarks, and how often it sends updates to the central manager,
##  you'd have to define the following helper macro:
#MY_CONSOLE_DEVICES = "$(CONSOLE_DEVICES)"
##  Note: this must come before you define STARTD_EXPRS because macros
##  must be defined before you use them in other macros or
##  expressions.
##  Then, you'd set the STARTD_EXPRS setting to this:
#STARTD_EXPRS = MY_CONSOLE_DEVICES, RunBenchmarks, UPDATE_INTERVAL

COLLECTOR_HOST_STRING = "$(COLLECTOR_HOST)"
STARTD_EXPRS = COLLECTOR_HOST_STRING

##  When the startd is claimed by a remote user, it can also advertise
##  arbitrary attributes from the ClassAd of the job its working on.
##  Just list the attribute names you want advertised.  
##  Note: since this is already a ClassAd, you don't have to do
##  anything funny with strings, etc.  This feature can be turned off
##  by commenting out this setting (there is no default).
STARTD_JOB_EXPRS = ImageSize, ExecutableSize, JobUniverse, NiceUser

##  If you want to "lie" to Condor about how many CPUs your machine
##  has, you can use this setting to override Condor's automatic
##  computation.  If you modify this, you must restart the startd for
##  the change to take effect (a simple condor_reconfig will not do).
##  Please read the section on "condor_startd Configuration File
##  Macros" in the Condor Administrators Manual for a further
##  discussion of this setting.  Its use is not recommended.  This
##  must be an integer ("N" isn't a valid setting, that's just used to
##  represent the default).
NUM_CPUS = 1

##  Normally, Condor will automatically detect the amount of physical
##  memory available on your machine.  Define MEMORY to tell Condor
##  how much physical memory (in MB) your machine has, overriding the
##  value Condor computes automatically.  For example:
#MEMORY = 128

##  How much memory would you like reserved from Condor?  By default,
##  Condor considers all the physical memory of your machine as
##  available to be used by Condor jobs.  If RESERVED_MEMORY is
##  defined, Condor subtracts it from the amount of memory it
##  advertises as available.
#RESERVED_MEMORY = 0

######
##  SMP startd settings
##
##  By default, Condor will evenly divide the resources in an SMP
##  machine (such as RAM, swap space and disk space) among all the
##  CPUs, and advertise each CPU as its own "virtual machine" with an
##  even share of the system resources.  If you want something other
##  than this, there are a few options available to you.  Please read
##  the section on "Configuring The Startd for SMP Machines" in the
##  Condor Administrator's Manual for full details.  The various
##  settings are only briefly listed and described here.
######

##  The maximum number of different virtual machine types.
#MAX_VIRTUAL_MACHINE_TYPES = 10

##  Use this setting to define your own virtual machine types.  This
##  allows you to divide system resources unevenly among your CPUs.
##  You must use a different setting for each different type you
##  define.  The "<N>" in the name of the macro listed below must be
##  an integer from 1 to MAX_VIRTUAL_MACHINE_TYPES (defined above),
##  and you use this number to refer to your type.  There are many
##  different formats these settings can take, so be sure to refer to
##  the section on "Configuring The Startd for SMP Machines" in the
##  Condor Administrator's Manual for full details.  In particular,
##  read the section titled "Defining Virtual Machine Types" to help
##  understand this setting.  If you modify any of these settings, you
##  must restart the condor_start for the change to take effect.
#VIRTUAL_MACHINE_TYPE_<N> = 1/4
#VIRTUAL_MACHINE_TYPE_<N> = cpus=1, ram=25%, swap=1/4, disk=1/4
#  For example:
#VIRTUAL_MACHINE_TYPE_1 = 1/8
#VIRTUAL_MACHINE_TYPE_2 = 1/4

##  If you define your own virtual machine types, you must specify how
##  many virtual machines of each type you wish to advertise.  You do
##  this with the setting below, replacing the "<N>" with the
##  corresponding integer you used to define the type above.  You can
##  change the number of a given type being advertised at run-time,
##  with a simple condor_reconfig.  
#NUM_VIRTUAL_MACHINES_TYPE_<N> = M
#  For example:
#NUM_VIRTUAL_MACHINES_TYPE_1 = 6
#NUM_VIRTUAL_MACHINES_TYPE_2 = 1

##  The number of evenly-divided virtual machines you want Condor to
##  report to your pool (if less than the total number of CPUs).  This
##  setting is only considered if the "type" settings described above
##  are not in use.  By default, all CPUs are reported.  This setting
##  must be an integer ("N" isn't a valid setting, that's just used to
##  represent the default).
NUM_VIRTUAL_MACHINES = 1

##  How many of the virtual machines the startd is representing should
##  be "connected" to the console (in other words, notice when there's
##  console activity)?  This defaults to all virtual machines (N in a
##  machine with N CPUs).  This must be an integer ("N" isn't a valid
##  setting, that's just used to represent the default).
#VIRTUAL_MACHINES_CONNECTED_TO_CONSOLE = N

##  How many of the virtual machines the startd is representing should
##  be "connected" to the keyboard (for remote tty activity, as well
##  as console activity).  Defaults to 1.
#VIRTUAL_MACHINES_CONNECTED_TO_KEYBOARD = 1

##  If there are virtual machines that aren't connected to the
##  keyboard or the console (see the above two settings), the
##  corresponding idle time reported will be the time since the startd
##  was spawned, plus the value of this parameter.  It defaults to 20
##  minutes.  We do this because, if the virtual machine is configured
##  not to care about keyboard activity, we want it to be available to
##  Condor jobs as soon as the startd starts up, instead of having to
##  wait for 15 minutes or more (which is the default time a machine
##  must be idle before Condor will start a job).  If you don't want
##  this boost, just set the value to 0.  If you change your START
##  expression to require more than 15 minutes before a job starts,
##  but you still want jobs to start right away on some of your SMP
##  nodes, just increase this parameter.
#DISCONNECTED_KEYBOARD_IDLE_BOOST = 1200

######
##  Settings for computing optional resource availability statistics:
######
##  If STARTD_COMPUTE_AVAIL_STATS = True, the startd will compute
##  statistics about resource availability to be included in the
##  classad(s) sent to the collector describing the resource(s) the
##  startd manages.  The following attributes will always be included
##  in the resource classad(s) if STARTD_COMPUTE_AVAIL_STATS = True:
##    AvailTime = What proportion of the time (between 0.0 and 1.0)
##      has this resource been in a state other than "Owner"?
##    LastAvailInterval = What was the duration (in seconds) of the
##      last period between "Owner" states?
##  The following attributes will also be included if the resource is
##  not in the "Owner" state:
##    AvailSince = At what time did the resource last leave the
##      "Owner" state?  Measured in the number of seconds since the
##      epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).
##    AvailTimeEstimate = Based on past history, this is an estimate
##      of how long the current period between "Owner" states will
##      last.
#STARTD_COMPUTE_AVAIL_STATS = False

##  If STARTD_COMPUTE_AVAIL_STATS = True, STARTD_AVAIL_CONFIDENCE sets
##  the confidence level of the AvailTimeEstimate.  By default, the
##  estimate is based on the 80th percentile of past values.
#STARTD_AVAIL_CONFIDENCE = 0.8

##  STARTD_MAX_AVAIL_PERIOD_SAMPLES limits the number of samples of
##  past available intervals stored by the startd to limit memory and
##  disk consumption.  Each sample requires 4 bytes of memory and
##  approximately 10 bytes of disk space.
#STARTD_MAX_AVAIL_PERIOD_SAMPLES = 100

##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Where are the various shadow binaries installed?

##  need to query the central manager to find the schedd.  This
##  feature can be turned off by commenting out this setting.
SCHEDD_ADDRESS_FILE	= $(LOG)/.schedd_address

##  How often should the schedd send an update to the central manager?

#ALIVE_INTERVAL		= 300

##  This setting controls the maximum number of times that a
##  condor_shadow processes can have a fatal error (exception) before
##  the condor_schedd will simply relinquish the match associated with
##  the dying shadow.
#MAX_SHADOW_EXCEPTIONS	= 5

##  Estimated virtual memory size of each condor_shadow process. 
##  Specified in kilobytes.
SHADOW_SIZE_ESTIMATE	= 1800

##  The condor_schedd can renice the condor_shadow processes on your

##  The higher the number, the lower priority the shadows have.
##  This feature can be disabled entirely by commenting it out.
SHADOW_RENICE_INCREMENT	= 10

##  By default, when the schedd fails to start an idle job, it will
##  not try to start any other idle jobs in the same cluster during
##  that negotiation cycle.  This makes negotiation much more
##  efficient for large job clusters.  However, in some cases other
##  jobs in the cluster can be started even though an earlier job
##  can't.  For example, the jobs' requirements may differ, because of
##  different disk space, memory, or operating system requirements.
##  Or, machines may be willing to run only some jobs in the cluster,
##  because their requirements reference the jobs' virtual memory size
##  or other attribute.  Setting NEGOTIATE_ALL_JOBS_IN_CLUSTER to True
##  will force the schedd to try to start all idle jobs in each
##  negotiation cycle.  This will make negotiation cycles last longer,
##  but it will ensure that all jobs that can be started will be
##  started.
#NEGOTIATE_ALL_JOBS_IN_CLUSTER = False

## This setting controls how often, in seconds, the schedd considers
## periodic job actions given by the user in the submit file.
## (Currently, these are periodic_hold, periodic_release, and periodic_remove.)
PERIODIC_EXPR_INTERVAL = 15

######
## Queue management settings:
######
##  How often should the schedd truncate it's job queue transaction
##  log?  (Specified in seconds, once a day is the default.)
#QUEUE_CLEAN_INTERVAL	= 86400

##  How often should the schedd commit "wall clock" run time for jobs
##  to the queue, so run time statistics remain accurate when the
##  schedd crashes?  (Specified in seconds, once per hour is the
##  default.  Set to 0 to disable.)
#WALL_CLOCK_CKPT_INTERVAL = 3600

##  What users do you want to grant super user access to this job
##  queue?  (These users will be able to remove other user's jobs). 
##  By default, this only includes root.
QUEUE_SUPER_USERS	= root, condor


##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  condor_shadow
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  If the shadow is unable to read a checkpoint file from the
##  checkpoint server, it keeps trying only if the job has accumulated
##  more than MAX_DISCARDED_RUN_TIME seconds of CPU usage.  Otherwise,
##  the job is started from scratch.  Defaults to 1 hour.  This
##  setting is only used if USE_CKPT_SERVER (from above) is True.
#MAX_DISCARDED_RUN_TIME = 3600 

##  Should periodic checkpoints be compressed?
#COMPRESS_PERIODIC_CKPT = False

##  Should vacate checkpoints be compressed?

##  Should we commit the application's dirty memory pages to swap
##  space during a periodic checkpoint?
#PERIODIC_MEMORY_SYNC = False

##  Should we write vacate checkpoints slowly?  If nonzero, this

##  be written, in kilobytes per second.
#SLOW_CKPT_SPEED = 0


##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  condor_starter
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  The condor_starter can renice the processes from remote Condor
##  jobs on your execute machines.  If you want this, uncomment the

##  jobs. (1-19)  The larger the number, the lower priority the
##  process gets on your machines.
#JOB_RENICE_INCREMENT	= 10

##  Should the starter do local logging to its own log file, or send
##  debug information back to the condor_shadow where it will end up
##  in the ShadowLog? 
#STARTER_LOCAL_LOGGING	= TRUE

##  If the UID_DOMAIN settings match on both the execute and submit
##  machines, but the UID of the user who submitted the job isn't in
##  the passwd file of the execute machine, the starter will normally

#APPEND_REQUIREMENTS	= (expression to append job requirements)
#APPEND_RANK		= (expression to append job rank)

##  If you want expressions only appended for either standard or
##  vanilla universe jobs, you can uncomment these entries.  If any of
##  them are defined, they are used for the given universe, instead of
##  the generic entries above.
#APPEND_REQ_VANILLA	= (expression to append to vanilla job requirements)
#APPEND_REQ_STANDARD	= (expression to append to standard job requirements)
#APPEND_RANK_STANDARD	= (expression to append to vanilla job rank)
#APPEND_RANK_VANILLA	= (expression to append to standard job rank)

##  This can be used to define a default value for the rank expression
##  if one is not specified in the submit file.
#DEFAULT_RANK	        = (default rank expression for all jobs)

##  If you want universe-specific defaults, you can use the following
##  entries:
#DEFAULT_RANK_VANILLA	= (default rank expression for vanilla jobs)
#DEFAULT_RANK_STANDARD	= (default rank expression for standard jobs)

##  If you want condor_submit to automatically append expressions to
##  the job ClassAds it creates, you can uncomment and define the
##  SUBMIT_EXPRS setting.  It works just like the STARTD_EXPRS
##  described above with respect to ClassAd vs. config file syntax,
##  strings, etc.  One common use would be to have the full hostname
##  of the machine where a job was submitted placed in the job
##  ClassAd.  You would do this by uncommenting the following lines: 
#MACHINE = "$(FULL_HOSTNAME)"
#SUBMIT_EXPRS = MACHINE

## Condor keeps a buffer of recently-used data for each file an

##  If you would like this machine to be able to run Java jobs,
##  then set JAVA to the path of your JVM binary.  If you are not
##  interested in Java, there is no harm in leaving this entry
##  empty or incorrect.

JAVA = /usr/bin/java

##  Some JVMs need to be told the maximum amount of heap memory
##  to offer to the process.  If your JVM supports this, give
##  the argument here, and Condor will fill in the memory amount.
##  If left blank, your JVM will choose some default value,
##  typically 64 MB.  The default (-Xmx) works with the Sun JVM.

JAVA_MAXHEAP_ARGUMENT = -Xmx

## JAVA_CLASSPATH_DEFAULT gives the default set of paths in which
## Java classes are to be found.  Each path is separated by spaces.
## If your JVM needs to be informed of additional directories, add
## them here.  However, do not remove the existing entries, as Condor
## needs them.

JAVA_CLASSPATH_DEFAULT = $(LIB) $(LIB)/scimark2lib.jar .

##  JAVA_CLASSPATH_ARGUMENT describes the command-line parameter
##  used to introduce a new classpath:

JAVA_CLASSPATH_ARGUMENT = -classpath

##  JAVA_CLASSPATH_SEPARATOR describes the character used to mark
##  one path element from another:

JAVA_CLASSPATH_SEPARATOR = :

##  JAVA_BENCHMARK_TIME describes the number of seconds for which
##  to run Java benchmarks.  A longer time yields a more accurate
##  benchmark, but consumes more otherwise useful CPU time.
##  If this time is zero or undefined, no Java benchmarks will be run.

JAVA_BENCHMARK_TIME = 2

##  If your JVM requires any special arguments not mentioned in
##  the options above, then give them here.

##  Condor-G settings

##  Where is the GridManager binary installed?

##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Settings that control the daemon's debugging output:
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##
## Note that the Gridmanager runs as the User, not a Condor daemon, so 
## all users must have write permssion to the directory that the 
## Gridmanager will use for it's logfile. Our suggestion is to create a
## directory called GridLogs in $(LOG) with UNIX permissions 1777 
## (just like /tmp )
##  Another option is to use /tmp as the location of the GridManager log.
## 

MAX_GRIDMANAGER_LOG	= 1000000
GRIDMANAGER_DEBUG	= D_COMMAND

#GRIDMANAGER_LOG = $(LOG)/GridLogs/GridmanagerLog.$(USERNAME)
GRIDMANAGER_LOG = $(LOG)/GridmanagerLog.$(USERNAME)

CONDOR_JOB_POLL_INTERVAL = 20

##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Various other settings that the Condor-G can use. 
##--------------------------------------------------------------------

## If we're talking to a Globus 2.0 resource, Condor-G will use the new
## version of the GRAM protocol. The first option is how often to check the
## proxy on the submit site of things. If the GridManager discovers a new
## proxy, it will restart itself and use the new proxy for all future 
## jobs launched. In seconds,  and defaults to 10 minutes
#GRIDMANAGER_CHECKPROXY_INTERVAL = 600

## The GridManager will shut things down 3 minutes before loosing Contact
## because of an expired proxy. 
## In seconds, and defaults to 3 minutes
#GRDIMANAGER_MINIMUM_PROXY_TIME  = 180

## Condor requires that each submitted job be designated to run under a
## particular "universe". Condor-G is active when jobs are as marked as
## "GLOBUS" universe jobs. The universe of a job is set in the submit file
## with the 'universe = GLOBUS' line. 
##
## If no universe is specificed in the submit file, Condor must pick one
## for the job to use. By default, it chooses the "standard" universe. 
## The default can be overridden in the config file with the DEFAULT_UNIVERSE
## setting, which is a string to insert into a job submit description if the
## job does not try and define it's own universe
##
#DEFAULT_UNIVERSE = globus

#
# The Cred_min_time_left is the first-pass at making sure that Condor-G
# does not submit your job without it having enough time left for the 
# job to finish. For example, if you have a job that runs for 20 minutes, and
# you might spend 40 minutes in the queue, it's a bad idea to submit with less
# than an hour left before your proxy expires.
# 2 hours seemed like a reasonable default.
