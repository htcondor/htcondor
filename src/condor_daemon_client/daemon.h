/** 
  Class used to pass around and store information about a given
  daemon.  You instantiate one of these objects and pass in the type
  of daemon you care about, and optionally, the name of the daemon and
  pool that it reports to.  The pool and name arguments both default
  to NULL, which means the local pool (the pool that the machine where
  the Daemon object was instantiated reports to) and the local  
  daemon, respectively.  

  <p>Once you have the object, you call the locate() method to have
  it actually try to find all the information about the daemon it can
  provide.  If you call member functions for info before you call
  locate(), the object will call locate() for you, though that can
  obscure errors, so it's generally discouraged.

  <p>If there are any errors, the error() method will stop returning
  NULL and start returning a string that describes the error, which
  can then be used for dprintf(), etc.

  <p>"The local daemon" means different things, depending on the type
  of daemon.  For central manager daemons (negotiator, collector,
  view_collector), it means the CM this machine is configured to use
  (which would normally be a remote host, unless you were
  instantiating the Daemon object on the CM itself).  For all other
  daemons (master, startd, schedd), it means the daemon running on the
  local host.

  <p>Information provided by the Daemon class includes the daemon's
  name (which could be a "condor" name such as
  "slot1@raven.cs.wisc.edu", or a full hostname), hostname, fully
  qualified hostname, address (sinful string), port, the type of the
  daemon (daemon_t enum), the pool it reports to (if it's a remote
  pool) and a bool that describes if the daemon is "local" (as
  described above).

  <p>We use this class to localize all the logic for finding daemons
  in one place, and all the rest of Condor now uses this class.  This
  way, when we add support for a new way of finding daemons (like
  address files, multiple network interface config parameters, etc),
  we can add the code to support it in one place, instead of peppered
  throughout the entire source tree.  */
