class EventHandlingBase(object):
    '''This class is used as a base by all classes implementing event handlers.

    Look at known subclasses (above in epydoc) to see which classes will allow you to
    attach your own callables (event handlers) to certain events occuring in them.

    Read the respective classes documentations to learn what events are provided by them. The
    events are always defined in a class whose name consist of the name of the class it provides
    events for followed by C{Events}). For example class L{ISkype} provides events defined in
    L{ISkypeEvents}. The events class is always defined in the same submodule as the main class.

    The events class is just informative. It tells you what events you can assign your event
    handlers to, when do they occur and what arguments lists should your event handlers
    accept.

    There are three ways of attaching an event handler to an event.

      1. C{Events} object.

         Use this method if you need to attach many event handlers to many events.

         Write your event handlers as methods of a class. The superclass of your class
         doesn't matter, Skype4Py will just look for methods with apropriate names.
         The names of the methods and their arguments lists can be found in respective
         events classes (see above).

         Pass an instance of this class as the C{Events} argument to the constructor of
         a class whose events you are interested in. For example::

             import Skype4Py

             class MySkypeEvents:
                 def UserStatus(self, Status):
                     print 'The status of the user changed'

             skype = Skype4Py.Skype(Events=MySkypeEvents())

         The C{UserStatus} method will be called when the status of the user currently logged
         into skype is changed.

      2. C{On...} properties.

         This method lets you use any callables as event handlers. Simply assign them to C{On...}
         properties (where "C{...}" is the name of the event) of the object whose events you are
         interested in. For example::

             import Skype4Py

             def user_status(Status):
                 print 'The status of the user changed'

             skype = Skype4Py.Skype()
             skype.OnUserStatus = user_status

         The C{user_status} function will be called when the status of the user currently logged
         into skype is changed.

         The names of the events and their arguments lists should be taken from respective events
         classes (see above). Note that there is no C{self} argument (which can be seen in the events
         classes) simply because our event handler is a function, not a method.

      3. C{RegisterEventHandler} / C{UnregisterEventHandler} methods.

         This method, like the second one, also let you use any callables as event handlers. However,
         it additionally let you assign many event handlers to a single event.

         In this case, you use L{RegisterEventHandler} and L{UnregisterEventHandler} methods
         of the object whose events you are interested in. For example::

             import Skype4Py

             def user_status(Status):
                 print 'The status of the user changed'

             skype = Skype4Py.Skype()
             skype.RegisterEventHandler('UserStatus', user_status)

         The C{user_status} function will be called when the status of the user currently logged
         into skype is changed.

         The names of the events and their arguments lists should be taken from respective events
         classes (see above). Note that there is no C{self} argument (which can be seen in the events
         classes) simply because our event handler is a function, not a method.

    B{Important notes!}

    The event handlers are always called on a separate thread. At any given time, there is at most
    one handling thread per event type. This means that when a lot of events of the same type are
    generated at once, handling of an event will start only after the previous one is handled.
    Handling of events of different types may happen simultaneously.

    In case of second and third method, only weak references to the event handlers are stored. This
    means that you must make sure that Skype4Py is not the only one having a reference to the callable
    or else it will be garbage collected and silently removed from Skype4Py's handlers list. On the
    other hand, it frees you from worrying about cyclic references.
