Aviary - Simplified RPC Interface for HTCondor
..............................................

Overview
========
This contrib provides a simplified web service interface for job submission, 
management, and queries. This interface was designed to abstract some of the 
complexity of HTCondor while at the same time provide access through a 
ubiquitous network transport such as HTTP. It currently uses SOAP for request 
and response exchanges between the HTCondor Aviary-enabled components and generic 
web service clients that can be developed using Java, Python, Ruby and other 
languages. The target audience for Aviary are those developers who need to 
quickly make use of HTCondor without having the time to consume the depth and 
breadth of knowledge associated with its entire HTC capabilities.

Birdbath versus Aviary
======================
Aviary is an alternative to the Birdbath SOAP interface. The key differences 
are:
	* Aviary uses WS02 and Axis2/C for its SOAP transport stack while Birdbath 
	uses gSOAP
	* The Aviary WSDL and XSD strives for simplicity while Birdbath offers a 
	relatively fine-grained API
	* Birdbath must be compiled into DaemonCore while Aviary is a contrib that 
	can be mixed into existing deployments that support HTCondor dynamic library 
	plug-ins
	* WS02 and Axis2/C are ASL2 while gSOAP uses an assortment of commercial, 
	public, and GPL v2 licenses

WS02 and Axis2/C
================
Axis2/C is a C-based SOAP engine that supports several of the WS-* standards
including WS-Addressing, WS-Security, and WS-Eventing:
http://axis.apache.org/axis2/c/core/

WS02 Web Services Framework for C++ is a C++ wrapper around Axis2/C. It 
generates C++ types from WSDL and XSD:
http://wso2.com/products/web-services-framework/cpp/

Model
=====
The entities of this API are:

    * job - A job is the basic unit of work. It has a minimum set of attributes, 
    including the full path of the command to be executed, arguments to that 
    command, the owner of the job, and requirements that provide information to 
    HTCondor for matching to a resource that can execute the job.
    * submission - A submission is an association of jobs under a common name 
    key, like "my_submission_for_today". Aviary can generate a submission name 
    if none is provided.
    * attribute - Attributes describe aspects of a job. Some attributes can be 
    set when the job is submitted or later edited when the job is still actively 
    being processed in the HTCondor job queue. HTCondor will specify many job 
    attributes after a submission but a user can also provide their own custom 
    attributes if they are meaningful to the execution of the application that 
    is represented by a job.
    * resource - A resource is an addressable service that forms the some part 
    of the HTCondor runtime. For example, a SCHEDULER or QUERY_SERVER.

SOAP and WSDL
=============
The API types are described using XML schema and the operations using WSDL. This 
schema-based approach allows developers to generate the code for types and 
operations into their preferred native programming language using a client web 
service toolkit. Some popular web service toolkits:

    * Apache Axis or CXF (Java)
    * Suds (Python)
    * Savon (Ruby)

Installation
============
RPM
---
Install the condor-aviary package for RHEL/Fedora. This will install the 
required software components, including the WSDL and schema files for Aviary:

	/var/lib/condor/aviary/services/job/aviary-common.xsd
	/var/lib/condor/aviary/services/job/aviary-job.wsdl
	/var/lib/condor/aviary/services/job/aviary-job.xsd
	/var/lib/condor/aviary/services/query/aviary-common.xsd
	/var/lib/condor/aviary/services/query/aviary-query.wsdl
	/var/lib/condor/aviary/services/query/aviary-query.xsd

These files can be used to develop a remote web service client.

NOTE: Currently, due to a limitation in the underlying web service stack 
(Axis2/C), it is not possible to dynamically retrieve the WSDL and imported XSD 
over HTTP using the ?wsdl URL syntax.

Python sample scripts are provided for job submission, control and queries. There 
are some supporting python scripts which need to be added to the system Python 
search path to make use of HTTPS and argument parsing. For example, from within 
the aviary/test directory:

	export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/module:$PYTHONPATH

A sample DAG submission script has also been provided. The user must ensure
the contents of that directory is writable for the condor_dagman log files to
be generated.

Source
------
Aviary can be included in a HTCondor source build using the following variables 
when cmake is invoked:

	-DWANT_CONTRIB:BOOL=TRUE -DWITH_MANAGEMENT:BOOL=TRUE -DWITH_AVIARY:BOOL=TRUE

Configuration
=============
Included is the Schedd plugin, AviaryScheddPlugin-plugin.so, and the aviary_query_server

# The general Aviary config file for Axis2
# axis2.xml has parameters that point to lib and services dir
WSFCPP_HOME=/var/lib/condor/aviary/axis2.xml

# Aviary Schedd plugin, provides submission and job control endpoint
SCHEDD.PLUGINS = $(SCHEDD.PLUGINS) $(LIB)/plugins/AviaryScheddPlugin-plugin.so

# Port the Aviary Schedd plugin listens on, default 39090
#SCHEDD.HTTP_PORT = 39090

# Aviary query server, provides endpoint for job and submission queries
QUERY_SERVER = $(SBIN)/aviary_query_server
QUERY_SERVER_ARGS = -f
QUERY_SERVER.QUERY_SERVER_LOG = $(LOG)/QueryServerLog
QUERY_SERVER.QUERY_SERVER_DEBUG = D_ALWAYS
DAEMON_LIST = $(DAEMON_LIST), QUERY_SERVER

# Port the QueryServer listens on, default 39091
#QUERY_SERVER.HTTP_PORT = 39091

# HISTORY_INTERVAL specifies the number of seconds between polls of the HISTORY file, default 120
#QUERY_SERVER.HISTORY_INTERVAL = 120

# If there is more than one Schedd on the system or if the Schedd and
# QueryServer reside on different systems, it is necessary to tell the
# QueryServer the name of the Schedd it is working with via
# QUERY_SERVER.SCHEDD_NAME. This allows the QueryServer to provide
# fully-qualified job ids, i.e. cluster.proc:pool:scheduler. Default
# is constructed in the same way the Schedd constructs its name.
#QUERY_SERVER.SCHEDD_NAME =

Core Types
==========
The XML schema defines some core types which are meaningful in understanding how 
the Aviary operations are to be invoked and their results interpreted.

JobId
-----
A unit of information that fully describes a job's identity:

    * job - The local identifier for a job assigned to a specific scheduler. It 
    is a string that encodes two positive integers like "1.0", "84.3", 
    "2001.68", etc. The first integer is a reference to a local job grouping 
    that may have multiple parts with attributes in common that are enumerated 
    by the second integer (for example, "1.0", "1.1", "1.2", "1.3", and so on). 
    The most typical example is a group of jobs that share the same command but 
    pass different arguments to the command, and in turn each job in the group 
    writes its output to a different file.
    * scheduler - A string that identifies where the job was submitted (schedd)
    * pool - A string that identifies a particular HTCondor deployment (an arena 
    of schedulers, job execution resources, and components that match jobs to 
    those resources).

SubmissionId
------------
A unit of information that describes a submission in two parts:

    * name - A string provided by the user or one that has been generated on the 
    user's behalf at submission time. Submission names can be thought of as a 
    way to associate and aggregate jobs in a way meaningful to the developer, 
    such as "my_submission_04302011". Since submissions are open-ended, a user 
    could keep adding individual submissions to this aggregating name over time 
    even though the individual jobs may have been scheduled and executed at 
    different times by HTCondor. For example, the jobs "1.0", "79.0", "2011.0" 
    could all be part of the submission named "my_submission_04302011".
    * owner - A string identifying the name of the original submitter.

Attribute
---------
An attribute is a type-coded piece of information used by HTCondor to evaluate, 
organize and execute job matching and processing. HTCondor jobs have multiple 
attributes, some of which are specified by the user prior to submission and many 
which are attached to a job by the HTCondor infrastructure when it is added to the 
job queue. Indeed, a HTCondor job is the sum of its attributes. An attribute 
consists of:

    * name - A string denoting the name of this attribute. Names are either 
    pre-defined names understood by the HTCondor infrastructure or a custom 
    attribute name.
    * type - An enumerated string with values STRING, INTEGER, FLOAT, 
    EXPRESSION, BOOLEAN
    * value - The string form of the value.

JobStatus
---------
A job can be in one of several states:

    * idle - The job is in a state where it is not ready or able to be assigned 
    to a resource yet.
    * running - The job is assigned to a computational resource and executing 
    there.
    * held - The job exists in the HTCondor job queue but is being held back from 
    execution.
    * completed - The job ran to completion.
    * removed - The job was deleted from the job queue by a user.

ResourceConstraint
------------------
A ResourceConstraint is a basic quality that HTCondor should consider when 
matching a new job to a resource. There are five enumerated basic constraints 
defined in Aviary:

    * OS - currently "LINUX" or WINDOWS" for the most prevalent operating 
    systems
    * ARCH - "INTEL" or "X86_64" for 32-bit or 64-pit platforms respectively, 
    important when the executable needed by the job is compiled to a particular 
    architecture
    * MEMORY - expected total RAM required to run job
    * DISK - expected total  disk space to run job
    * FILESYSTEM - the domain name representing a uniformly mounted network file 
    system, configured by a HTCondor administrator

Job Submission and Management
=============================

Operations
----------

- submitJob

Input:
    * cmd - a string with the absolute path to an executable or script
    * args - an optional string containing arguments for the cmd
    * owner - a string identifying the submitter
    * iwd - the initial working directory where the job will be executed
    * submission_name - an optional string identifying the submission that 
    should be created or that this job should be attached to
    * requirements - an optional list of ResourceConstraints that specify what 
    type of resource this job should be targetted toward
    * extra - an optional list of Attributes that refine the submit request 
    beyond the basic fields or supercede the HTCondor Attributes implied by the 
    other basic fields in this submit request
Output: OK or error with diagnostic text if a problem was encountered	

Experienced HTCondor users who are familiar with crafting specific attributes such 
as complex Requirements can do so using the extra Attributes field in 
conjunction with the allowOverrides XML attribute in the request.

- holdJob
Input: a single JobId and a hold reason (string)	
Output: OK, or error with text if job not found or parsed	

A hold is a temporary interruption of execution of a job against a resource; 
holds can be used to affect job attribute edits without going through 
re-submission.

- releaseJob
Input: a single JobId and a release reason (string)
Output: OK, or error with text if job not found or parsed

Releasing a job is moving it out of the held state back to where it is ready to 
be scheduled again with a resource.

- removeJob
Input: a single JobId and a remove reason (string)
Output: OK, or error with text if job not found or parsed

Removal of a job means that the job is prevented from executing to completion, 
however its existence in the HTCondor job queue is still maintained as a matter of 
record.

- setJobAttribute
Input: a single JobId and a single Attribute
Output: OK, or error with text if job not found or parsed

Attributes are predefined by HTCondor or can be created by the user, for example, 
using a name/type/value shorthand:

    * "JobPrio"/"INTEGER"/"2" - would be the shorthand for the job attribute 
    predefined by HTCondor to control job priority, set to a value of 2 giving it 
    higher priority than the default priority of 0
    * "Recipe"/"STRING"/"secret sauce" - would be the shorthand for a custom 
    job attribute provided by a user, only meaningful to their application and 
    irrelevant to the HTCondor infrastructure

Job Data Queries
================

Operations
----------

- getJobStatus

Input: zero to many JobIds
Ouput: returns the current status for each JobId input, or an error indicating 
the job could not be parsed or found 

This is the most efficient query since it returns the least amount of data per 
job

- getJobSummary

Input: zero to many JobIds
Output: returns a summary for each JobId input, or an error indicating the job 
could not be parsed or found

The summary will include the following:

    * command
    * command arguments
    * scheduler local time when job was added to job queue
    * scheduler local time of last update to job status
    * job status
    * reason why job was held, released, or removed

- getJobDetails

Input: zero to many JobIds
Output: returns all the Attributes for each JobId input, or an error indicating 
the job could not be parsed or found 

This is a potentially expensive operation since one could request ALL the 
attributes for ALL the jobs tracked in HTCondor; consider judicious use of 
summaries for select job sets instead if performance is a concern

- getJobData

Input: a single JobId, the type of data file content requested (ERR, OUT, 
LOG), the maximum number of bytes to be returned, and whether the file should be 
read from the front or back	
Output: the file content requested if successful

Each job can specify an error file (ERR), a log file (LOG), or an output file 
(OUT); the log file is used by HTCondor to monitor the progress of the job

- getSubmissionSummaries

Input: zero to many SubmissionIds
Output: for each valid submission returned, the following job totals will be 
listed:

    * completed
    * held
    * idle
    * removed
    * running
	* transferring output
	* suspended

Individual job summaries can also be included in the response by setting the 
XML attribute includeJobSummaries to be true in the request.

Security
========

Aviary provides transport-layer security via HTTPS mutual authentication. The CA
of the client certificate must be registered with the Aviary services in order 
to successfully invoke them when SSL is enabled. The SSL certificates and keys 
can be configured with the following:

AVIARY_SSL = TRUE
AVIARY_SSL_SERVER_CERT = /path/to/server/certificate/file
AVIARY_SSL_SERVER_KEY = /path/to/server/private/key/file
AVIARY_SSL_CA_DIR = /path/to/server/ca/directory
AVIARY_SSL_CA_FILE = /path/to/server/ca/file

Note that the config value of HTTP_PORT applies in both cases regardless of
whether SSL is enabled or not. So if SSL is enabled, the Aviary server will
listen securely at the value of HTTP_PORT.

OpenSSL provides utilities for managing PKI. The following link is a decent
reference:
http://www.madboa.com/geek/openssl/

Locator
=======

Aviary provides a "bootstrap" WSDL interface for finding other Aviary SOAP 
endpoints called the locator. This is implemented within a Collector-specific 
plugin that receives generic ClassAds from Aviary endpoint publishers that 
contain a fully-formed base URL with which a client can invoke their target 
services. The client must still append the appropriate target operation to the 
end of the URL. 

When a locator is configured, Aviary endpoints will bind to ephemeral ports 
on their respective hosts and publish their addressable URL to the locator 
plugin. Upon graceful exit, endpoints will notify the locator plugin through 
ad invalidation. For failed endpoints, the plugin monitors regular updates of 
the published ads and prune them using a policy of missed update count over a 
configurable interval.

The default locator can be invoked at port 39000 on the Collector host (e.g.,
http://localhost:39000/services/locator/locate)

Arguments to the locate operation:
* ResourceType (required and one of 'ANY','COLLECTOR','CUSTOM','MASTER',
			  'NEGOTIATOR','SCHEDULER','SLOT')
* name (optional, fragment or exact full name of endpoint host)
* sub_type (optional full string of a subtype of CUSTOM resource like 'QUERY_SERVER')

Exact matching (applicable to name field only) can be used in the locate request 
by setting the XML attribute partialMatches to be false in the request. The sub_type 
field must always be an exact match.

Relevant configuration variables and their defaults:

AVIARY_PUBLISH_LOCATION = False 
(locator publishing on or off)

AVIARY_PUBLISH_INTERVAL = 10 
(frequency in seconds that endpoints send out their heartbeat ad)

AVIARY_LOCATOR_PRUNE_INTERVAL = 20 
(frequency in seconds that the locator plugin sweeps and marks unresponsive or 
missing endpoints)

AVIARY_LOCATOR_MISSED_UPDATES = 2
(the number of updates an endpoint can miss before becoming a candidate for
garbage collection from the available list)

The following example shows the request and response SOAP XML for a job 
submission.

Ruby
----
The following example shows a Ruby Savon web service client that also generates 
a basic submission.

# uses Savon http://savonrb.com/
require 'rubygems'
# httpi >= 0.9.2
require 'httpi'
# savon >= 0.9.1
require 'savon'
require "openssl"

client = Savon::Client.new do |wsdl|
  wsdl.document = "/var/lib/condor/aviary/services/job/aviary-job.wsdl"
  wsdl.endpoint = "http://localhost:39090/services/job/submitJob"
end

xml =  Builder::XmlMarkup.new
xml.cmd("/bin/sleep")
xml.args("40")
xml.owner("condor")
xml.iwd("/tmp")

response = client.request :job, "SubmitJob" do
    soap.namespaces["xmlns:job"] = "http://job.aviary.grid.redhat.com"
    soap.body = xml.target!
end


Python
------
This example shows a Python Suds web service client that invokes one of the job 
query operations based on user input. It also takes an optional job id argument.

# uses Suds - https://fedorahosted.org/suds/
import logging
from suds import *
from suds.client import Client
from sys import exit, argv, stdin
import time

# enable these to see the SOAP messages
#logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
#logging.getLogger('suds.client').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# change these for other default locations and ports
job_wsdl = 'file:/var/lib/condor/aviary/services/query/aviary-query.wsdl'

cmds = ['getJobStatus', 'getJobSummary', 'getJobDetails']

cmdarg = len(argv) > 1 and argv[1]
cproc =  len(argv) > 2 and argv[2]
job_url = len(argv) > 3 and argv[3] or "http://localhost:39091/services/query/"

if cmdarg not in cmds:
    print "error unknown command: ", cmdarg
    print "available commands are: ",cmds
    exit(1)

client = Client(job_wsdl);
job_url += cmdarg
client.set_options(location=job_url)

# enable to see service schema
#print client

# set up our JobID
if cproc:
    jobId = client.factory.create("ns0:JobID")
    jobId.job = cproc
else:
    # returns all jobs
    jobId = None

try:
    func = getattr(client.service, cmdarg, None)
    if callable(func):
        result = func(jobId)
except Exception, e:
    print "invocation failed: ", job_url
    print e
    exit(1)

print result
