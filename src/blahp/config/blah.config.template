#Set to yes to enable delegation (instead of copy) of renewed proxies
#to worker nodes. NOTE: limited *and* delegated proxes are not 
#accepted for default GSI authentication as of VDT 1.2, so this should
#be enabled only if non-limited proxies are used for proxy renewal. (default = no)

#These two attributes allow to change the directory on the worker node where 
#the batch system is instructed to transfer input/output sandbox files to
