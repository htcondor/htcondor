/** The ProcAPI class returns information about running processes.  It is

     <li> One pid.
     <li> A set of pids.
     <li> A pid and all of that pid's descendants.
    </ul>
    When you ask for information, a procInfo structure is returned to
    you containing the following:
    <ul>
     <li> Image size and resident set size.
     <li> Page faults (major & minor) per second.
     <li> % cpu usage.
     <li> Time spent in user and system modes.
     <li> The "wall clock" age of the process.
    </ul>
    Note that all of this information is returned at once.  This is because
    the operating system usually returns several of these values together
    in a structure, and it would be inefficient to repeatedly make system
    calls when only one call is really needed.  Also, 8 values * 3 types
    of things to get values for...equals 24 functions, which is way too many.
    <p>
    Note: memory for the procInfo structure can be allocated by the caller.
    If you pass a NULL pointer to one of the functions, space will be
    allocated for you.  Things will be bad if you pass a non-allocated, 
    non-NULL pointer into a member function.  Don't forget to deallocate
    the procInfo structure when done!

	<p>
	Note: Since there is no need to instantiate multiple copies of
	this class, the whole class is static, and should just never be
	instantiated at all.
