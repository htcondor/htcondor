08/02/02 V6_5-tdp-branch
	 	Branch for all the "TDP" work, which stands for "Tool Daemon
	 	Protocol".  This is the work to integrate Condor with
	 	Paradyn, creating paused processes, etc.  Branched off of the

		on the (now abandoned) V6_3-tdp-branch.

7/25/02 V6_5_0-PRE-RELEASE-1

	and has support for the new parallel universe.

07/19/02 V6_5-branch
	The V6_5 development series branch.  For important,
	low-hanging new features.  We should try to keep this branch
	so it's always ready to be released within a week, if needed.
	This development series should only last for a month of
	development, and then be hardened for another stable release.
	as soon as the trunk (new classads) porting is done in the
	most basic level, and daemons with new classads can run jobs
	and pass the test suite, we will freeze development in 6_5,
	have a few people work to make it stable, and finally move all
	development into new classads.  yee haw!

		The V6_3-security-2-branch immediately after it was created.

11/13/01 V6_3-security-2-branch
		Created from the V6_3-branch.  The V6_3-security-branch will be
		merged into this one via the very impressive tag
		V6_3-security-branch-pre-merge-V6_3-security-branch-2.  Yowza!

11/13/01 V6_3-security-branch-pre-merge-V6_3-security-branch-2
		The V6_3-security-branch in its final state.  This tag is

11/8/01 V6_3-bandwidth-merge-1
        The end of the old bandwidth branch at the point where we
        merged it into V6_3-bandwidth-2-branch.  Hopefully, we'll
        never need this tag, but if we end up having to do more
        development on the old bandwidth branch and re-merge, this is
        the "last-merged-at" tag we'll need to use.

11/8/01 V6_3-bandwidth-2-branch
        A new bandwidth branch for Sonny's bandwidth and private
        network changes.  This was created off the end of the
        V6_3-branch so that all the RedHat 7.1 porting can be used for
        Sonny's work.  The old V6_3-bandwidth-branch will be merged
        directly into this new branch and then abandoned.

10/10/01 V6_3_1-Condor-G
        The V6_3-branch built with WANT_GLOBUS = YES, for a CondorG release. 
        It's just slightly post V6_3_1, with just a few GridManager changes.

10/09/01 V6_3-security-branch
		Branch for Zach's security-related changes.  Taken off the
		V6_3-branch right after the V6_3_1 release tag.  Only the

        The state of the V6_2-branch (after v6.2.1 and soon before
        release of v6.2.2) when we merged it into V6_3-branch.  Note
        that there is no V6_2-merge-5 tag.... because that is really
        the V6_2_1 tag.

9/17/01 V6_3-INFN-CondorG-2
        Basically, the V6_3-INFN-CondorG-6_3_1 tag, with an bug fix
        from the V6_3-branch to condor_event.C. Then added new
        features to the grid manager to log submit-to-globus-failed
        events, and globus-up and down events.

8/29/01 V6_3-post-merge-V6_3_0-branch-merge-3
        The state of the V6_3-branch after we merged in the

8/23/01 V6_3-INFN-CondorG-6_3_1
        The V6_3-branch of what we're calling 6.3.1. It's a CondorG
        release with the new recoverable job manager support added,
        proxy management, DUROC support, and more info in the user
        log. Because of the Grid Manager re-write, it's not clear when
        this will go to someone other than INFN and Jim Basney.
 
8/17/01 V6_3_0-merge-3
        The state of the V6_3_0-branch before we merged it into 
        the V6_3-branch.

8/16/01 V6_3-post-merge-V6_3-syscall-hack-branch-merge-1
        This is the state of the V6_3-branch after we merged the
        V6_3-syscall-hack-branch tagged at
        V6_3-syscall-hack-branch-merge-1.

8/16/01 V6_3-pre-merge-V6_3-syscall-hack-branch-merge-1
        This is the state of the V6_3-branch before we merged the

        The 6.2.1 release tags, which lives on the V6_2-branch. 

6/4/01 V6_3-syscall-hack-branch-fixed_varargs
        REMOTE_syscall() has been removed and honest to god senders
        with real function names have been created. This tag also
        includes clipped support for redhat 7.1.  By the way, I can't
        put all the senders in seperate .o files mainly because of
        alias linking where you need to resolve against stuff you
        didn't bring in. So they all must come in.

5/22/01 V6_3-post-authentication
        The V6_3-branch right after zach's authentication stuff.

5/22/01 V6_3-pre-authentication
        The V6_3-branch before zach's authentication stuff, which

        the V6_3-branch for the air force.

       The state of the V6_3-branch before merging in the
       V6_3_0-branch as tagged at V6_3_0-merge-2.

5/1/01 OR 5/3/01(don't know from merge) V6_3-syscall-hack-branch
       New branch for doing massive hacking to the remote syscall
       infrastructure to avoid using va_args, having a giant
       do_remote_syscall() function, etc.  Instead, we'll now generate
       seperate functions for each RSC we're trapping, and ideally, put
       them all in seperate .o files, too.

5/1/01 V6_3-post-merge-V6_3_0-merge-1
       The state of the V6_3-branch after merging in the

        the V6_3-branch for the new syscall branch and the air force.

    A tag VALID ONLY ON SRC that represents the 6_3-branch right before
    Hao checked in his Kerberos stuff. Some files in config/ were checked
    in before this tag was added. (site.def - 1.21.8.5 and Project.tmpl 
    1.68.4.11) 

4/18/01 V6_3_0-branch
        A branch off of V6_3 for the 6.3.0 release of Condor.  This is
        to insulate the 6.3.0 release from other changes to the
        repository as we get 6.3.0 ready to ship.  Hopefully, this
        branch will be abandonded once 6.3.0 is out and any changes
        have been merged back into V6_3-branch.  However, we might
        have to release a 6.3.1 from this branch, as well, depending
        on how things go in the V6_3-branch, and how stable it is
        whenever we need to release 6.3.1.

        The state of the V6_3-branch before merging the
        still-slightly- post-6.2.0 V6_2 branch in preparation for
        releasing 6.3.0.  (Phew.)

        V6_2 branch state, still slightly post 6.2.0.  Used for
        merging into the V6_3 branch, in preparation for releasing
        6.3.0.

4/9/01 V6_3-umn-branch  (take two)
        This is a new branch (with the same name) for UMN folks who
        want to hack DAGMan.  Since the old umn branch was created
        before the big CEDAR cleanup in CVS, and since we didn't want
        any trouble with that down the road, we wanted to make a new
        branch for them before they started their work.  Since nothing
        had been checked in to the new branch, we could safely delete
        the old branch tag (which I did in both the V6_3-branch and in
        the V6_3-bandwidth-branch to make sure we removed that tag
        from all files, even ones that had been deleted on the main
        V6_3-branch), and re-tag with the same name, creating a new
        branch.

4/3/01 V6_3-bandwidth-branch
        A new branch off of V6_3 for all the bandwidth control stuff.
        This branch contains modifications to condor_io and
        condor_includes.

        The state of the V6_3-branch before I started doing all the
        trickery to create the V6_3-bandwidth-branch, just in case we
        need to back out of any mistakes I might make.  -Derek Wright

3/30/01 V6_3-condor-g-release-2
        The release tag for the second CondorG client-distro. This
        release is from the mainline V6_3-branch, and not the

        New branch off of V6_3-branch for UMN folks who want to hack

        V6_2-branch state, slightly post 6.2.0. Used for the merge
        into 6.3 at the end of March (right around the CondorG merge
        back in, and the split-off of the Minnesota DAGMan branch)

3/15/01 V6_2_0 
        6.2.0 release tags, which lives on the V6_2-branch. The date
        on this release is probably bogus, since I forgot to add it to
        this file til well after the fact.

3/6/01  V6_3-galileo-1
        This is a tag of the V6_3 branch for the purposes of giving

        V6_3-branch at the appropriate time.

2/9/01  V6_1_17
        6.1.17 release tag, which lives on the V6_2-branch. The good

12/22/00 V6_2-merge-2
        V6_2 branch state (still prior to 6.1.17, so not quite worthy
        of the V6_1_17 tag) for merging into V6_3 branch

12/6/00 V6_3-post-merge-V6_2-merge-1
        The state of the V6_3-branch after merging in the V6_2-branch
        as tagged at V6_2-merge-1.

        The state of the V6_3-branch before merging in the V6_2-branch
        as tagged at V6_2-merge-1.

12/6/00 V6_2-merge-1
        V6_2 branch state (just prior to 6.1.17, so not quite worthy
        of the V6_1_17 tag) for merging into V6_3 branch

9/14/00 V6_3-post-merge-V6_1_16
        The state of the V6_3-branch after merging in the V6_2-branch
        as tagged at V6_1_16.

9/13/00 V6_3-pre-merge-V6_1_16
        The state of the V6_3-branch before merging in the V6_2-branch
        as tagged at V6_1_16.

9/8?/00 V6_1_16
        6.1.16 release tag, which lives on the V6_2-branch.  config
        was tagged on 9/12, with the code from the earlier date.
        NTconfig and doc were tagged on 9/13/00 with the tail of the
        branch (since I don't think NTconfig changed, doc didn't
        change much, and it doesn't matter nearly as much) There are
        now a bunch more module names and renewed awareness of using
        the *_ALL module names to help avoid these sorts of things in
        the future.  -Derek

8/22/00 V6_1_15
        6.1.15 release tag, which lives on the V6_2-branch.

7/6/00 V6_3-branch
        The branch for all of Condor version 6.3.X (and, probably,
        6.4.X).  Changes made on the V6_2-branch should always be
        merged into this branch, not the trunk.  This branch should be
        merged into the trunk periodically.  6.3.X should contain new
        features, Globus universe stuff, Condor-G, Personal Condor
        stuff, etc.  It should *NOT* contain new classads, new schedd,
        etc, etc. 

7/6/00 V6_2-branch The branch for all of Condor version 6.2.X.  In
        addition, the last few 6.1.X releases (hopefully, just
        6.1.15), will live on this branch.  config, src, doc, and
        NTconfig are all branched.  Changes from this branch should
        *NEVER* be merged directly into the trunk.  They *MUST* be
        merged into the V6_3-branch, and then, those changes should be
        merged from the V6_3-branch into the trunk.

7/6/00 trunk-post-merge-V6_1_14
        The state of the trunk aftering merging with V6_1_13-branch as

6/13/00 V6_1_NewAds-3-branch
        This branch has been created to merge in trunk changes with
        the obsolescent V6_1-NewAds-2-branch (which is now going to
        be abandoned).

6/7/00 V6_1_13-branch
        Branch for 6.1.13, so the trunk can start to withstand
        checkins slated for 6.1.14.

5/23/00 V6-preSol28-port
        A tag right before we checked in all the stuff for the
        Solaris 2.8 port.

3/15/00 V6_1_12-diff-ckpt-branch
        A branch for Greg Bronner <gbronner> and John Bent <johnbent>
        to work on experimental code to only checkpoint diffs instead
        of the whole memory image.  Branched from the trunk, somewhere
        between 6.1.12 and 6.1.13.

3/6/00 V6_1_12
        The 6.1.12 release tag, which lives on the trunk.

12/23/99 V6_1_11-pre1
        A pre-release of Version 6.1.11.  This state of the trunk was
        released in two ways: 1) A negotitator for IRIX 6.2 was given
        to CORE in response to [condor-support #237] and this is what
        the "6.1.10" glidein tarballs released on 12/23/99 were built
        with. 

11/24/99 V6_1_10
        The 6.1.10 release tag, which lives on the trunk.

11/19/99 V6_1_10-CAE-beta
        A beta version of 6.1.10 that I (Derek) packaged for CAE for
        clipped Solaris 2.7 support.  I didn't release the real 6.1.10
        today because I ran out of time.  I just wanted to tag this in
        case they have problems so we know what code they have.

10/20/99 V6_1_8-ntpreview-branch
        This is branch used to build the first NT release, 
        Condor NT Preivew v6.1.8.

        Compiled only for sparc solaris 551 and given to them in binary form.

6/7/99 V6_1-pre-merge-V6_1-Irix65-1-branch-merge-1
        Tag of Trunk before merging Irix branch back in

6/7/99 V6_1-Irix65-1-branch-merge-1

4/20/99 V6_1_5-pre-merge-V6_1-unix-dc-pm-1-branch-merge-1
        This impressively-named tag is of the trunk, right
        before the merge of the unix-dc-pm branch.

4/20/99 V6_1-unix-dc-pm-1-branch-merge-1
        This tag is made on the unix-dc-pm branch before that
        branch's merge back into the trunk.  Hopefully
        we won't ever have to worry about this tag ever again.  :-)
        WANT_DC_PM is turned on in the master and schedd, 
        Create_Process is used, and the schedd's "Agent" is gone.

4/15/99 V6_1_5
        The 6.1.5 release.  Lots of new features, including Condor for
        machines w/ multiple network interfaces, the new Daemon
        object, removed some dead APIs in internet.c, converted some
        things to CEDAR that weren't using it, and tons of bug fixes. 

3/16/99 V6_1-NewAds-2-branch
        This is the second branch for the New-Classads/egcs/STL
        conversion process.  We created the new branch, then we will
        merge the V6_1-NewAds-branch directly into this new branch,
        not the trunk.  Eventually, this branch will be merged into
        the trunk once it's at 6.3.X.

3/16/99 V6_1-co-alloc-1-branch
        Branch created for Adiel to use for his changes to the
        negotiator to support co-allocation of licences w/ machines
        (primarily for CORE).

3/16/99 V6_1-unix-dc-pm-1-branch
        Branch to get DaemonCore (DC) Process Management (PM) working
        on Unix before it gets merged into the trunk.  This will
        hopefully be done quickly and merged back in before we move to
        V6_2.  After this branch was created, the initial check-ins to
        enable Unix DCPM to the schedd were undone on the trunk, since
        they were creating too many problems.

3/11/99 son-of-vics-branch
        New branch for Vic Zandy to do his process hijacking work on.
        The vics-branch was abandonded since there were so many
        changes on the trunk that it would be hell to merge back in. 

3/11/99 new-syscall-branch
        New branch for Doug Thain's re-do of remote syscalls, file
        table stuff, buffering, etc. 

3/9/99  V6_1-pre-merge-V6_1_4
        The trunk, before merging in the V6_1_3-branch, which contains
        both V6_1_3 and V6_1_4.  We're merging from where V6_1_4 is
        tagged. 

3/3/99  V6_1_4
        Version 6.1.4, tagged on the V6_1_3-branch.  Almost
        exclusively bug fixes to V6_1_3, including the fix to the
        fatal FPE exception caused by uninitialized memory in Cedar. 

2/26/99 V6_1_3
        Version 6.1.3, tagged on the V6_1_3-branch.  Lots of SMP bug
        fixes, but lots of other new, unstable features.

2/?/99  V6_1_3-branch
        Branch to get 6.1.3 ready for release.

1/13/99 V6_1-pre-merge-V6_1_2
        The trunk, before merging in the V6_1_1-branch, which contains
        both V6_1_1 and V6_1_2.  We're merging from where V6_1_2 is
        tagged. 

1/12/99 V6_1_2
        Most directories are tagged on the V6_1_1-branch, with some
        bug fixes and improvements after the V6_1_1 release was
        tagged.  However, V6_1_2 includes the trunk versions of
        condor_dagman and the pvm directories:
        condor_(shadow|starter).jim.  

?/?/98 V6_1_1
        Version 6.1.1, tagged on the V6_1_1 branch.

12/21/98 V6_1_1-branch

        tagged, not config.

12/9/98 V6_1_0
