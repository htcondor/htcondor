  read_multiple_logs.C (1.6.2.8), and read_multiple_logs.h (1.5.2.4).

  when most thought that my Condor hacking days were long gone, I've
  come back out of nowhere with a vengence. You can try to sweat over

   develop his code to support virtual machines. 
   Created from the V6_7-branch of V6_7_CODE by Alain Roy. Our hope is
   to merge this back in mid-January 2005 for Condor 6.7.15, but
   that's only if the code is good enough. 

12/21/05 V6_7-cron-2-{root,branch}
   Cleaning up the CronTab code and finalize it after PCRE is working
   for Windows. I had to merge a new branch because Todd turned on
   the Windows external after I had made my starter_local_expr branch.
   Created from the V6_7-branch of V6_7_CODE.

12/20/05 V6_7-boinc-{root,branch}
   Branch for Derek's efforts to get Condor to run a BOINC client
   (http://boinc.berkeley.edu) whenever the startd doesn't have any

   the successful build from BUILD-V6_7-branch-2005-12-20.

12/19/05 V6_7-win32_tests-{root,branch}
   Branch for bill's efforts to get condor_tests workin on windoze.

12/19/05 V6_7-eventd_v2-{root,branch}
   Branch for bill's eventd development efforts.  Created from the

12/19/05 V6_7-new_classads-{root,branch}
   Branch for using an old-classads compatibility interface on top of
   the new classad implementation.  This will not be merged back into
   V6_7 before 6.8.0, but will probably be merged early in the 6.9.x
   series.  Created from the V6_7-branch of V6_7_CODE after andy
   committed fixes to condor_tests from BUILD-V6_7-branch-2005-12-19.

12/19/05 V6_7-gridftp-{root,branch}
   Branch for developing Condor-started gridftp servers for GT4 GRAM jobs.

   the Starter for local universe jobs. I also plan to clean up my CronTab code
   and finalize it after PCRE is working for Windows.

12/07/05 V6_7-cron-merge-1
   A branch that adds cron capabilities, job deferral, and time offset
   This was created by Derek from V6_7-branch on the V6_7_ALL module.

12/02/05 V6_6-merge-51
   The state of the V6_6-branch for a merge into V6_7-branch.  Bring
   the minor negotiator fix for ignoring poorly formed schedd ads, the

   for incorporating uniq process identifier code into Condor,
   specifically into ProcAPI and KillFamily.  Only code branched.

11/06/05 V6_7_13-2-merge-1
   The state of the V6_7_13-2-branch for the first (and hopefully
   only) merge into V6_7.  This includes the fixes for the windoze
   for() loop scoping troubles, and a new GCB external.

11/04/05 V6_7-db_logs_nonblocking-3-branch
   Another branch for the "quill++" work.  This one comes
   from V6_7_13-2-root.

11/04/05 V6_7_13-2-branch
   The real release branch for the 6.7.13 release.  because of the
   previous failed attempt on V6_7_13-branch, we have to use this
   somewhat non-conventional name. :(  created from V6_7_13-2-root on
   the V6_7_CODE module.

11/03/05 V6_6-merge-50
   The state of the V6_6-branch for a merge into V6_7-branch.  moves
   todd's new "jobs define their own JOB_START_DELAY" feature from
   V6_6 into V6_7 (though it conflicts heavily with changes in V6_7,
   so for now, it's commented out), some minor condor_tests fixes, and
   nmi_glue changes to use the version of condor_nmi_submit from the
   build's run directory, not a hard-coded path on grandcentral.
   This *should* be the final V6_6 -> V6_7 merge before the 6.7.13
   release (which was previously delayed for a number of reasons).

11/02/05 V6_7_13-merge-1
   The state of the V6_7_13-branch for a merge into V6_7-branch.  The
   original V6_7_13-branch was supposed to be abandoned, but folks
   still checked into it.  so, we're merging these changes back into
   V6_7 before we make the real 6.7.13 branch (V6_7_13-2-branch). 

10/31/05 V6_7_13-gcb-pre_release-2005-10-31
   A 6.7.13 pre-release specifically for GCB.  Initially given to
   Gaurang Mehta <gmehta@ISI.EDU>.  The version string is:
   $CondorVersion: 6.7.13 Oct 31 2005 PRE-RELEASE-UWCS $

10/14/05 V6_7-cron-branch
   A branch off of V6_7 for Andy Pavlo's work to add cron-like
   scheduling to various parts of Condor.  This is initially motivated
   by efforts to use Condor for INCA, but many of the features will be
   useful for other sites, too.  Functionality slated for this branch
   includes: job "deferal" in the starter to spawn a job at a specific
   time, a Requirements expression for local universe jobs, cron-like
   scheduling attributes for jobs that turn into a time-to-next-start
   clause in the requirements expr, etc.  Created from the
   V6_7-cron-root tag on the V6_7_CODE module.

10/13/05 V6_7_13-branch
   A branch for the 6.7.13 release, created from V6_7_13-root on the
   V6_7_ALL module.  Therefore, the "doc" directory is branched, too.
   This is NOT the release branch for 6.7.13.  See V6_7_13-2-branch.

10/13/05 V6_6-merge-49
   The state of the V6_6-branch for a merge into V6_7-branch.  fixes
   some minor condor_tests, nmi_glue, and autoconf stuff.  this is the
   final V6_6 -> V6_7 merge before the 6.7.13 release.

10/07/05 V6_7-gcb-2-merge-1
   The state of the V6_7-gcb-2-branch for the first (and final) merge
   into the V6_7-branch.  This is the first time GCB support will go
   into the mainline codebase.

10/05/05 V6_6-merge-48
   The state of the V6_6-branch for a merge into V6_7-branch.  Fixes
   a bunch of condor_tests stuff, such that we should be close to all
   green (at least we were on V6_6, a few intermittent failures on AIX
   notwithstanding), NMI glue, the nmi_glue/submit_info input file for
   the new/improved condor_nmi_submit.pl script, a fix in CEDAR to
   deal with badly formed packets not causing an EXCEPT(), and some
   other minor fixes (e.g. to clarify some dprintfs, a README, etc).

9/28/05 V6_7-SC2005_Stork_Demo_3-{root,branch}
   New branch based off V6_7-root in which development for the SC2005
   Stork demo will be done.

   *Abondoned*
   New branch based off V6_7-root in which development for the SC2005
   Stork demo will be done.

09/26/05 V6_7_12-merge-1
   The state of the V6_7_12-branch for a (probably final) merge into
   the V6_7-branch.  This pulls all of the changes from both the
   V6_7_11-branch and V6_7_12-branch that were made for 6.7.12 (two
   critical bug fixes: one to dagman, and one to daemon_core for
   win32).  This merge will include everything since V6_7_11-merge-1.

09/26/05 V6_7_12-win32
   The official 6.7.12 release tag for WIN32.  Unfortunately, we've
   got seperate tags and packages for the WIN32 and UNIX releases of
   6.7.12, but the only diff was inside an #ifdef WIN32, and it was
   easier to just stick with the existing unix tarballs.  The windoze
   binaries came from NWO build #xxxxx.  The version string for this
   release is:
       $CondorVersion: 6.7.12 Sep xx 2005 $

   from NWO build #11654.  6.7.11 is known bad and the relesae was
   pulled before being widely advertised.  The version string for 
   this release is:
       $CondorVersion: 6.7.11 Sep 15 2005 $

9/19/05 V6_7-Technion-ha4-{root,branch}
   A branch based off V6_7_11-root in which further HA development
   will be done.  Both code and docs are branched.

09/18/05 V6_7_11-merge-1
   The state of the V6_7_11-branch for a (probably final) merge into
   the V6_7-branch.  This includes a few last minute fixes for 6.7.11,
   along with the results from V6_6-merge-47.

09/15/05 V6_6-merge-47
   The state of the V6_6-branch for a merge into V6_7_11-branch.
   Mostly for the show-stopper startd bug when it hits errors trying

   goodies came along for the ride and will be in the 6.7.11 release.

9/14/05 V6_7_11-branch
   A branch for the 6.7.11 release, created from V6_7_11-root on the
   V6_7_CODE module.  The "doc" directory hasn't yet been branched.

09/07/05 V6_7-post_merge-V6_6-merge-45
   The state of the V6_7-branch before after merging in the V6_6-branch
   as it stood at tag V6_6-merge-45,
   EXCEPT for the patch to fix the StatInfo object to correctly
   detect symbolic links on Unix platforms.  This patch needs to
   be rewritten for v6.7 and will follow in another commit.
   Specifically, the patch being ommitted from this merge is
   src/condor_c++_util/directory.C ver 1.11.10.2.12.4.2.24 / Gnats 537.

09/07/05 V6_7-pre_merge-V6_6-merge-45

   the last V6_6 -> V6_7 merge before the 6.7.11 release.

09/07/05 V6_7-lease-merge-1
   The state of the V6_7-lease-branch for a merge into V6_7-branch. This
   should be the end of V6_7-lease-branch.

09/01/05 V6_7-quill-merge-1
   Abandoning V6_7-quill-branch, merging into V6_7-branch.
   This is the merge-from tag on V6_7-quill-branch.

08/30/05 V6_7-pre_merge-V6_7_10-merge-1
   The state of the V6_7-branch before merging in the V6_7_10-branch
   as it stood at tag V6_7_10-merge-1. 

08/18/05 V6_7_10-merge-1
   Abandoning V6_7_10-branch, merging into the V6_7-branch.

   A branch for the "quill++" work.

08/03/05 V6_7_10
   The official 6.7.10 release.  The packages for most platforms came
   from NWO build #9645, except irix-6.5 came from OWO build 1315, and
   windows was built by hand.  This is almost exactly the same source
   as BUILD-V6_7_10-branch-2005-8-3, however, there were 3 minor
   changes to files in NTconfig that were necessary.  Since that
   didn't touch the source at all, it wasn't worth a whole other
   build.  The version string for this release is:
   $CondorVersion: 6.7.10 Aug  3 2005 $

08/02/05 V6_7-workspace_svc-branch
   The branch for work on dynamic account management using Globus 
   Workspace Management service into the SchedD/Shadow. Will
   be needed until we either incorporate the said functionality
   into a release series or decide we no longer need it.

08/02/05 V6_7-workspace_svc-root

   V6_7-worksapce_cvs-branch

8/02/05 V6_7_10-branch
   A branch for the 6.7.10 release, created from V6_7_10-root on the
   V6_7_CODE module.  The "doc" directory hasn't yet been branched.

07/28/05 V6_7-lease-branch
   A branch for adding the new job lease code. This branch should last
   a couple month at most. Created from the V6_7-lease-root tag on 
   V6_7_CODE.

07/28/05 V6_6-merge-44
   The state of the V6_6-branch for a merge into V6_7-branch. This

   The point on the V6_7-dag_subdir-branch from which we do the first
   (and only) merge to the V6_7-branch.

06/30/05 V6_7_9-2-branch
   A new branch for the 6.7.9 release, created from V6_7_9-2-root on
   the V6_7_CODE module (doc will remain with the V6_7_9-branch).
   There were too many changes and merges that had to happen, and it
   was easier (and will be cleaner in the long run) to just make a new
   release branch than to do everything in the old V6_7_9-branch.

06/29/05 V6_6-merge-43
   The state of the V6_6-branch for a merge into V6_7-branch. This
   includes more bug fixes, including the schedd crash on reconfig

   few other minor changes.

06/29/05 V6_7_9-merge-1
   The state of the V6_7_9-branch before being merged into V6_7 and
   abandoned.  We'll need a new V6_7_9-2-branch for the real 6.7.9. 

6/27/05 V6_7-dag_subdir-branch
    A branch for the DAGMan subdirectory support feature (run multiple
    DAGs in separate directories), created from the V6_7-branch.  
    Hopefully this branch will only last a few days, but the complexity 
    of changes for this feature was getting pretty high...

06/27/05 V6_7_9-branch
   A branch for the 6.7.9 release, created from V6_7_9-root on the
   V6_7_ALL module.

06/24/05 V6_7-parallel-3-merge-1

   Windows. Also fixing some bugs noticed by Francesco/G-Lite people.
   Author: ckireyev

06/14/05 V6_7_8-merge-1
   The state of the V6_7_8-branch for a merge into V6_7-branch. The only
   changes are last-minute check-ins for GT4 and workarounds for problems
   in GT2 and blahp.

   OWO Build# 1169, NWO Build# 7644

06/10/05 V6_7_8
   The official 6.7.8 release tag, off of the V6_7_8-branch of
   V6_7_ALL and the trunk of V6_7_8_EXT.  Created from
   BUILD-V6_7_8-branch-2005-6-9.  Version string in this release:
   $CondorVersion: 6.7.8 Jun  9 2005 $

06/02/05 V6_6-merge-41
   The state of the V6_6-branch for a merge into V6_7-branch. This includes
   a win32 firewall fix, preventing the schedd from panicing when

   never clean the job queue if it got reconfiged frequently.

06/02/05 V6_7_8-branch
   A branch for the 6.7.8 release, created from V6_7_8-root on the
   V6_7_ALL module.

05/18/05 V6_7-globus4-branch
   A branch to test updating the Globus external to 4.0.0. This will
   hopefully be a very short-lived branch. Created from the 
   V6_7-globus4-root tag on V6_7_CODE.

05/17/05 V6_7-gcb-2-branch
   A new branch off V6_7 for the final (hopefully) GCB integration.
   This is the branch that's just going to rely on the GNU ld's --wrap
   functionality to re-map socket calls to Generic_*, instead of
   changing all the Condor source.  we'll still have to make some
   fixes, e.g. in my_ip_addr(), but this will be much easier to
   maintain, and it'll also work with most of the externals, too.
   Created from the V6_7-gcb-2-root tag on V6_7_CODE..

05/17/05 V6_6-merge-40
   The state of the V6_6-branch for a merge into V6_7-branch.  This
   includes some win32 bug fixes to submit, a big memory/resource leak

   V6_7_CODE module. 

04/26/05 V6_6-merge-39

   includes some more win32 bug fixes to leaking memory, dynuser,
   firewall stuff, etc.  Also included: removed a bogus ASSERT() in
   DAGMan, some enhancements to condor_tests, NMI glue, the
   gridmanager_monitor_agent, the 1-time vs. periodic DC timer bug in
   the schedd, and minor dprintf() fixes in the idle_time code.

04/18/05 V6_7-quill-branch

   includes a bunch of win32 bug fixes: the execute directory cleanup
   code, win32 Directory::chown() implementation and dynuser bug
   fixes.  Also includes some schedd fixes for shutdown behavior and
   some fixes to some tests in condor_tests.

03/31/05 V6_6-merge-37
   The state of the V6_6-branch for a merge into V6_7-branch.  This

   authenticate code returns a NULL username (due to a failed

   V6_6 (since they are totally new features), but they're being given
   to INFN from code as close to the stable 6.6.1 release as possible.
   This branch was created from the V6_6-infn-root tag.

02/11/04 V6_6_1
   The official 6.6.1 release tag!  This is a re-tagging of
   "BUILD-V6_6-branch-2004-2-5" with a few minor modifications for

   and on the trunk for the V6_6_1_EXT module of the externals tree.
   In NMI land most of the binaries/tarballs came from build ID 2732.
   The test suite ran on most platforms as is reported on that build
   ID.  IRIX was built manually due to various evil things.  
   The version string for all platforms (except IRIX and maybe 
   windows) is: "$CondorVersion: 6.6.1 Feb 5 2003 $"

   will be merged directly into this one and then abandoned.  Created
   from the V6_7-mirror-2-root tag.

02/01/04 V6_7-mirror-merge-1

   features for CORE.  These include:
   - schedd replication/fail-over
   - condor_vacate_job <job.id>
   Created from the V6_7-core-2-root tag.  We will merge this branch 
   back into V6_7-branch once we're done and sure it's stable.

12/08/03 V6_7-core-branch
   A new branch off of V6_7-branch for adding some custom features for
   CORE.  These include:
   - disconnected shadow/starter (and schedd/startd) operation, so
     that vanilla jobs can continue to make progress even if the
     submit machine crashes, reboots, etc.
   - group-based accounting in the schedd + negotiator
   Created from the V6_7-core-root tag.  We will merge this branch

   Just want to get all of the bug fixes and other minor changes since
   the last merge into V6_7-branch before we start making lots of
   other branches off of that (core, unicore, stork, stale-classads,
   etc).

   The state of the V6_6-branch when first merged into V6_7-branch.
   This is after V6_6_0, but before V6_6_1.  This is the first merge
   from V6_6-branch -> V6_7-branch.  it includes the entire autoconf +
   externals build system, the rh8 full port, an updated copyright
   notice, and all the bug fixes for V6_6_0 (and some that will show
   up for V6_6_1). 

11/27/03 V6_6-branch-post-redhat80-fullport-checkin
	This is the state of the V6_6-branch just after I checked in the full
	port for the redhat 8.0 revision of Linux.

11/27/03 V6_6-branch-pre-redhat80-fullport-checkin
	This is the state of the V6_6-branch just before I checked in the full
	port for the redhat 8.0 revision of Linux.

11/14/03 V6_6_0
   The official 6.6.0 release tag!  This is a re-tagging of
   "BUILD-V6_6-branch-2003-11-13" and "BUILD-V6_6_0-2003-11-12" (both
   of which might go away eventually).  This tag lives on the
   V6_6-branch for the V6_6_ALL module, and on the trunk for the
   entire externals tree.  In NMI land most of the binaries/tarballs
   came from build ID 1715.  The test suite ran on most platforms via
   build #1707 (equivalent source tag).  Solaris 9 and MacOSX had to
   be tested by hand, and Alpha-DUX-40f had to be built and tested by
   hand due to unexplainable errors building the globus external via
   the nightly builds.  Hopefully IRIX will use this same tag
   eventually, but right now, we don't have a functional build machine
   to use.  Maybe NMI will be stable enough to do the full build by
   6.6.1.  The version string for all platforms (except IRIX and maybe
   windows) is: "$CondorVersion: 6.6.0 Nov 13 2003 $"
   NOTE: this is also the last tag of the source that includes all the
   build system wisdom regarding X86 Solaris, Solaris 2.5.1, IRIX 6.2,
   and pre-glibc versions of Linux (everything before rh7.2, in fact).
   I modified all the build system files to purge these platforms
   since we're no longer supporting them, and they were causing
   needless complication in various ways.  This change also
   corresponds with moving platform detection from condor_imake into
   the configure script under the new build system.  Finally, i purged
   a bunch of really old code from condor_ckpt and condor_syscall_lib,
   such as: AIX3.2, ULTRIX, SUNOS, HPUX9, and IRIX53.

11/10/03 HAWKEYE_V1_0_RC3
    Release Candidate 3 of Hawkeye 1.0.

11/04/03 V6_6_0-analyze
   The 6.6.0 version of condor_analyze, which lives on the trunk.  The
   condor_analyze we include in 6.6.0 is really a version of condor_q
   from the trunk with new classads.  it was built manually on linux
   (i386_rh72), and will be included in the 6.6.0 tarballs for that
   platform by the build system.  The condor_analyze binaries included
   in 6.6.0 have this version string: 
   "$CondorVersion: 6.6.0 Nov  5 2003 CONDOR_ANALYZE-BETA $"

10/22/03 V6_6-post_merge_V6_6-externals-merge-1
   The state of the V6_6-branch after merging the
   V6_6-externals-branch as tagged at V6_6-externals-merge-1.
   The V6_6-externals-branch is now abandonded.

10/22/03 V6_6-externals-merge-1
   The state of the V6_6-externals-branch when it was merged back into
   V6_6-branch.  We'll abandon the V6_6-externals-branch after this
   merge, and move all development on the new system onto the
   V6_6-branch for the 6.6.x stable series.

10/22/03 V6_6-pre_merge_V6_6-externals-merge-1
   The state of the V6_6-branch before merging the
   V6_6-externals-branch as tagged at V6_6-externals-merge-1.

10/03/03 V6_7-soap-branch
   A new branch off V6_7-branch to hold our initial effort
   at incorporating SOAP interfaces into the Condor daemons.
   Primary goal of producing snapshots for our SciDac collaborators
   at LBNL to produce a demo using our soap work at SuperComputing.
   Created from the V6_7-soap-root tag.  We will merge this branch
   back into V6_7-branch once it stabilizes more... ideally after
   V6_7-branch has the List of Shame work (so we can add gSOAP as
   an external), but before we go back to the trunk.

9/25/03 V6_6-externals-branch
   A new branch off the V6_6-branch for checking in the solution to
   the "list of shame": the new "externals" directory and related
   changes to our Imake system.  This will be a short-lived branch.
   Once everything is working on all our platforms, this branch will
   be merged back into V6_6-branch and abandoned.  The only reason it
   exists is so that the V6_6-branch isn't broken while we work out
   the kinks with the new externals system.  Created from the
   V6_6-externals-root tag.  Does *not* include doc (since there's no
   user visible changes to document).

9/12/03 V6_7-tdp-branch
   A new branch off V6_7-branch for continued work on the TDP (Tool
   Daemon Protocol).  Created from the V6_7-tdp-root tag.  We will
   attempt to merge the older V6_5-tdp-2-branch into this.

9/11/03 V6_7-branch
   A new branch off the end of the V6_5-branch for the 6.7.x
   development series.  Created from the V6_6-root tag.  Includes the
   doc directory.

9/11/03 V6_6-branch
   A new branch off the end of the V6_5-branch for the 6.6.x stable
   series.  Created from the V6_6-root tag.  Includes the doc
   directory.

9/11/03 V6_5_5
   The 6.5.5 release tag.  It's also the end of the V6_5-branch, and
   the same versions of files as the root of V6_6-branch and
   V6_7-branch (although those will have their own tags, as well).  In
   addition to everything in the V6_5_ALL module, V6_5_5 is also found
   in the gahp directory (which lives next to src, config, and so on)
   on the trunk.

9/4/03 V6_5-dag-java-fix
   The state of the V6_5-branch used for a pre-release 6.5.5 DAGMan
   executable sent to Jens at Fermi (see condor-admin #7370).
   "6.5.5 Sep  4 2003 PRE-RELEASE" is the version string.
   This fixes a bug that caused DAGMan post scripts to be run with
   the signal mask not fully open (resulting in java hanging when
   run in a post script).

8/25/03 V6_5-dag-crash-fix
   The state of the V6_5-branch used for a pre-release 6.5.5 DAGMan
   executable sent to Duncan and Scott at UW-Milwaukee (see condor-admin
   #7292).  "6.5.5 Aug 25 2003 PRE-RELEASE" is the version string.
   This fixes a bug in the logging of events to the *.dagman.out file
   that may have caused DAGMan crashes Duncan and Scott have seen.

8/12/03 V6_5-post-gridshell-vdt_1_1_10
   The state of the V6_5-branch after merging in the
   V6_5-gridshell3-branch as tagged at gridshell-vdt_1_1_10

8/12/03 V6_5-pre-gridshell-vdt_1_1_10
   The state of the V6_5-branch before merging in the
   V6_5-gridshell3-branch as tagged at gridshell-vdt_1_1_10

8/12/03 gridshell-vdt_1_1_10
    The state of the V6_5-gridshell3-branch that was used to build the
    gridshell-related binarines (condor_gridmanager and
    condor_gridshell) that were used in the VDT 1.1.10 release.
    (note: the V6_5-gridshell3-branch only exists for src and config)

7/29/03 V6_5-gridshell3-post-V6_5-gridshell2-merge-1
    The state of the V6_5-gridshell3-branch after it had the changes
    from V6_5-gridshell2-branch (as tagged at V6_5-gridshell2-merge-1)
    merged in.

7/29/03 V6_5-gridshell3-branch
   A new branch off of V6_5-branch for further GridShell work.
   Depending on the state of the CVS repository and our plans for the
   GridShell, when this is completed, it'll either get merged into the
   V6_6-branch or the V6_7-branch.  Created from V6_5-gridshell3-root,
   so it'll be easy to merge these changes into any other branch as
   needed.  We needed a 3rd gridshell branch because of more bug fixes
   to the starter on V6_5-branch for COD that we want in the
   gridshell.  So, we made a new branch and will merge the changes
   from V6_5-gridshell2-branch into here..  

7/29/03 V6_5-gridshell2-merge-1
    The state of the V6_5-gridshell2-branch when it was merged into
    V6_5-gridshell3-branch and then abandoned.

7/28/03 V6_5_4
   The 6.5.4 release, which lives on the V6_5-branch. 

7/22/03 V6_5-gridshell2-branch
   A new branch off of V6_5-branch for adding support for the
   GridShell.  depending on the state of the CVS repository and our
   plans for the GridShell, when this is completed, it'll either get
   merged into the V6_6-branch or the V6_7-branch.  Created from
   V6_5-gridshell2-root, so it'll be easy to merge these changes into
   any other branch as needed.  We needed a 2nd gridshell branch
   because some changes were made to the starter on V6_5-branch for
   COD that we need in the gridshell, and it was easier to just make a
   new branch (since nothing had been checked into the old one).

7/18/03 V6_5_4-COD-contrib-2
    The state of the V6_5-branch used for a pre-release 6.5.4 COD
    contrib module sent to Maarten at MIT (see [condor-admin #6613]).
    "$CondorVersion: 6.5.4 Jul 18 2003 COD-PRE-RELEASE $" is the
    version string I sent it with.  this fixes the minor bug in the

   any other branch as needed.

    where started to get this branch building and working again.

03/04/03 V6_5-MB-V6_5-cod-merge-1-branch
    the *right* name for the COD->V6_5 merge branch.  because of the
    extensive changes required for COD and various things that were
    changed on V6_5 (how CEDAR authenticate() works, and the starter
    exception userlog event), i decided to use a merge-branch for this
    merge so that we can track the changes i had to make to resolve
    conflicts and get everything working after the merge.

    a failed attempt at a merge-branch for merging COD into
    V6_5-branch.  this is *NOT* the right naming scheme, so i'm

    this tag completely. :(

	 	Branch for all the "TDP" work, which stands for "Tool Daemon
	 	Protocol".  This is the work to integrate Condor with
	 	Paradyn, creating paused processes, etc.  Branched off of the
	 	main V6_3-branch.  ABANDONED - use the V6_5-tdp-branch.

02/07/02 V6_3-pre-globus2_0-switch
		The V6_3-branch, right before we switched over to use
		Globus2.0.  There was one release of Condor (6.3.2

		V6_3-branch

11/13/01 V6_3-security-2-branch-original
		The V6_3-security-2-branch immediately after it was created.

11/13/01 V6_3-security-2-branch
		Created from the V6_3-branch.  The V6_3-security-branch will be
		merged into this one via the very impressive tag
		V6_3-security-branch-pre-merge-V6_3-security-branch-2.  Yowza!

11/13/01 V6_3-security-branch-pre-merge-V6_3-security-branch-2
		The V6_3-security-branch in its final state.  This tag is
		merged into V6_3-security-2-branch, and the original
		V6_3-security-branch is abandoned.

11/09/01 V6_3-security-branch
		When the V6_3-security-branch was originally made, only
		files in src/ were tagged. (See below 10/09/01).  This
		branches NTconfig, config, and doc as well.

11/8/01 V6_3-bandwidth-merge-1
        The end of the old bandwidth branch at the point where we
        merged it into V6_3-bandwidth-2-branch.  Hopefully, we'll
        never need this tag, but if we end up having to do more
        development on the old bandwidth branch and re-merge, this is
        the "last-merged-at" tag we'll need to use.

11/8/01 V6_3-bandwidth-2-branch
        A new bandwidth branch for Sonny's bandwidth and private
        network changes.  This was created off the end of the
        V6_3-branch so that all the RedHat 7.1 porting can be used for
        Sonny's work.  The old V6_3-bandwidth-branch will be merged
        directly into this new branch and then abandoned.

10/10/01 V6_3_1-Condor-G
        The V6_3-branch built with WANT_GLOBUS = YES, for a CondorG release. 
        It's just slightly post V6_3_1, with just a few GridManager changes.

10/09/01 V6_3-security-branch
		Branch for Zach's security-related changes.  Taken off the
		V6_3-branch right after the V6_3_1 release tag.  Only the
		src/ directory was branched by mistake, see above (11/09)

10/08/01 V6_3_1

        The state of the V6_2-branch (after v6.2.1 and soon before
        release of v6.2.2) when we merged it into V6_3-branch.  Note
        that there is no V6_2-merge-5 tag.... because that is really
        the V6_2_1 tag.

9/17/01 V6_3-INFN-CondorG-2
        Basically, the V6_3-INFN-CondorG-6_3_1 tag, with an bug fix
        from the V6_3-branch to condor_event.C. Then added new
        features to the grid manager to log submit-to-globus-failed
        events, and globus-up and down events.

8/29/01 V6_3-post-merge-V6_3_0-branch-merge-3

8/23/01 V6_3-INFN-CondorG-6_3_1
        The V6_3-branch of what we're calling 6.3.1. It's a CondorG
        release with the new recoverable job manager support added,
        proxy management, DUROC support, and more info in the user
        log. Because of the Grid Manager re-write, it's not clear when
        this will go to someone other than INFN and Jim Basney.
 
8/17/01 V6_3_0-merge-3
        The state of the V6_3_0-branch before we merged it into 
        the V6_3-branch.

8/16/01 V6_3-post-merge-V6_3-syscall-hack-branch-merge-1
        This is the state of the V6_3-branch after we merged the
        V6_3-syscall-hack-branch tagged at
        V6_3-syscall-hack-branch-merge-1.

8/16/01 V6_3-pre-merge-V6_3-syscall-hack-branch-merge-1
        This is the state of the V6_3-branch before we merged the

        The 6.2.1 release tags, which lives on the V6_2-branch. 

6/4/01 V6_3-syscall-hack-branch-fixed_varargs
        REMOTE_syscall() has been removed and honest to god senders
        with real function names have been created. This tag also
        includes clipped support for redhat 7.1.  By the way, I can't
        put all the senders in seperate .o files mainly because of
        alias linking where you need to resolve against stuff you
        didn't bring in. So they all must come in.

5/22/01 V6_3-post-authentication
        The V6_3-branch right after zach's authentication stuff.

5/22/01 V6_3-pre-authentication
        The V6_3-branch before zach's authentication stuff, which

        The state of the V6_3_0-branch when we again merged it into
        the V6_3-branch for the air force.

       The state of the V6_3-branch before merging in the
       V6_3_0-branch as tagged at V6_3_0-merge-2.

5/1/01 OR 5/3/01(don't know from merge) V6_3-syscall-hack-branch
       New branch for doing massive hacking to the remote syscall
       infrastructure to avoid using va_args, having a giant
       do_remote_syscall() function, etc.  Instead, we'll now generate
       seperate functions for each RSC we're trapping, and ideally, put
       them all in seperate .o files, too.

5/1/01 V6_3-post-merge-V6_3_0-merge-1
       The state of the V6_3-branch after merging in the
       V6_3_0-branch as tagged at V6_3_0-merge-1.

5/1/01 V6_3-pre-merge-V6_3_0-merge-1
       The state of the V6_3-branch before merging in the
       V6_3_0-branch as tagged at V6_3_0-merge-1.

        The state of the V6_3_0-branch when we first merged it into
        the V6_3-branch for the new syscall branch and the air force.

4/19/01  V6_3-pre-kerberos
    A tag VALID ONLY ON SRC that represents the 6_3-branch right before
    Hao checked in his Kerberos stuff. Some files in config/ were checked
    in before this tag was added. (site.def - 1.21.8.5 and Project.tmpl 
    1.68.4.11) 

4/18/01 V6_3_0-branch
        A branch off of V6_3 for the 6.3.0 release of Condor.  This is
        to insulate the 6.3.0 release from other changes to the
        repository as we get 6.3.0 ready to ship.  Hopefully, this
        branch will be abandonded once 6.3.0 is out and any changes
        have been merged back into V6_3-branch.  However, we might
        have to release a 6.3.1 from this branch, as well, depending
        on how things go in the V6_3-branch, and how stable it is
        whenever we need to release 6.3.1.

4/16/01 V6_3-pre-merge-V6_2-merge-4
        The state of the V6_3-branch before merging the
        still-slightly- post-6.2.0 V6_2 branch in preparation for
        releasing 6.3.0.  (Phew.)

4/16/01 V6_2-merge-4
        V6_2 branch state, still slightly post 6.2.0.  Used for
        merging into the V6_3 branch, in preparation for releasing
        6.3.0.

4/9/01 V6_3-umn-branch  (take two)
        This is a new branch (with the same name) for UMN folks who
        want to hack DAGMan.  Since the old umn branch was created
        before the big CEDAR cleanup in CVS, and since we didn't want
        any trouble with that down the road, we wanted to make a new
        branch for them before they started their work.  Since nothing
        had been checked in to the new branch, we could safely delete
        the old branch tag (which I did in both the V6_3-branch and in
        the V6_3-bandwidth-branch to make sure we removed that tag
        from all files, even ones that had been deleted on the main
        V6_3-branch), and re-tag with the same name, creating a new
        branch.

4/3/01 V6_3-bandwidth-branch
        A new branch off of V6_3 for all the bandwidth control stuff.
        This branch contains modifications to condor_io and
        condor_includes.

        The state of the V6_3-branch before I started doing all the
        trickery to create the V6_3-bandwidth-branch, just in case we
        need to back out of any mistakes I might make.  -Derek Wright

3/30/01 V6_3-condor-g-release-2
        The release tag for the second CondorG client-distro. This
        release is from the mainline V6_3-branch, and not the
        V6_3-condor-g-branch, which is now abandoned.

3/29/01 V6_3-umn-branch
        New branch off of V6_3-branch for UMN folks who want to hack
        DAGMan.

        The state of the V6_3-branch before merging the V6_2 branch

3/28/01 V6_2-merge-3
        V6_2-branch state, slightly post 6.2.0. Used for the merge
        into 6.3 at the end of March (right around the CondorG merge
        back in, and the split-off of the Minnesota DAGMan branch)

3/15/01 V6_2_0 
        6.2.0 release tags, which lives on the V6_2-branch. The date
        on this release is probably bogus, since I forgot to add it to
        this file til well after the fact.

3/6/01  V6_3-galileo-1
        This is a tag of the V6_3 branch for the purposes of giving

        A branch for Condor-G development in anticipation of a release
        in the near future.  Branched from the end of the V6_3-branch
        at 5:45pm on 2/28/01.  Only Condor-G development should go on
        on this branch, and it should be merged back into the regular
        V6_3-branch at the appropriate time.

2/9/01  V6_1_17
        6.1.17 release tag, which lives on the V6_2-branch. The good

        The state of the V6_3-branch before merging in the V6_2-branch
        as tagged at V6_2-merge-2.

12/22/00 V6_2-merge-2
        V6_2 branch state (still prior to 6.1.17, so not quite worthy
        of the V6_1_17 tag) for merging into V6_3 branch

12/6/00 V6_3-post-merge-V6_2-merge-1
        The state of the V6_3-branch after merging in the V6_2-branch

        as tagged at V6_1_16.

9/8?/00 V6_1_16
        6.1.16 release tag, which lives on the V6_2-branch.  config
        was tagged on 9/12, with the code from the earlier date.
        NTconfig and doc were tagged on 9/13/00 with the tail of the
        branch (since I don't think NTconfig changed, doc didn't
        change much, and it doesn't matter nearly as much) There are
        now a bunch more module names and renewed awareness of using
        the *_ALL module names to help avoid these sorts of things in
        the future.  -Derek

        6.4.X).  Changes made on the V6_2-branch should always be
        merged into this branch, not the trunk.  This branch should be
        merged into the trunk periodically.  6.3.X should contain new
        features, Globus universe stuff, Condor-G, Personal Condor
        stuff, etc.  It should *NOT* contain new classads, new schedd,
        etc, etc. 

7/6/00 V6_2-branch The branch for all of Condor version 6.2.X.  In
        addition, the last few 6.1.X releases (hopefully, just
        6.1.15), will live on this branch.  config, src, doc, and
        NTconfig are all branched.  Changes from this branch should
        *NEVER* be merged directly into the trunk.  They *MUST* be
        merged into the V6_3-branch, and then, those changes should be
        merged from the V6_3-branch into the trunk.

7/6/00 trunk-post-merge-V6_1_14

        Branch for 6.1.13, so the trunk can start to withstand
        checkins slated for 6.1.14.

        clipped Solaris 2.7 support.  I didn't release the real 6.1.10
        today because I ran out of time.  I just wanted to tag this in
        case they have problems so we know what code they have.

6/16/99 V6_1-pre-merge-V6_1_7
        The trunk, before merging in the V6_1_6-branch, as tagged at

        The 6.1.7 release tag, which lives on the V6_1_6-branch.

        Some bugs fixes related to fortran.
        Compiled only for sparc solaris 551 and given to them in binary form.

6/7/99 V6_1-pre-merge-V6_1-Irix65-1-branch-merge-1
        Tag of Trunk before merging Irix branch back in

6/7/99 V6_1-Irix65-1-branch-merge-1
        Tag of Irix branch before merging

        Branch for the 6.1.6 release.

4/27/99 V6_1-Irix65-1-branch
        Branch for doing Irix 6.5 porting on. 

4/20/99 V6_1_5-pre-merge-V6_1-unix-dc-pm-1-branch-merge-1
        This impressively-named tag is of the trunk, right
        before the merge of the unix-dc-pm branch.

4/20/99 V6_1-unix-dc-pm-1-branch-merge-1
        This tag is made on the unix-dc-pm branch before that
        branch's merge back into the trunk.  Hopefully
        we won't ever have to worry about this tag ever again.  :-)
        WANT_DC_PM is turned on in the master and schedd, 
        Create_Process is used, and the schedd's "Agent" is gone.

4/15/99 V6_1_5
        The 6.1.5 release.  Lots of new features, including Condor for
        machines w/ multiple network interfaces, the new Daemon
        object, removed some dead APIs in internet.c, converted some
        things to CEDAR that weren't using it, and tons of bug fixes. 

3/16/99 V6_1-NewAds-2-branch
        This is the second branch for the New-Classads/egcs/STL
        conversion process.  We created the new branch, then we will
        merge the V6_1-NewAds-branch directly into this new branch,
        not the trunk.  Eventually, this branch will be merged into
        the trunk once it's at 6.3.X.

3/16/99 V6_1-co-alloc-1-branch
        Branch created for Adiel to use for his changes to the
        negotiator to support co-allocation of licences w/ machines
        (primarily for CORE).

3/16/99 V6_1-unix-dc-pm-1-branch
        Branch to get DaemonCore (DC) Process Management (PM) working
        on Unix before it gets merged into the trunk.  This will
        hopefully be done quickly and merged back in before we move to
        V6_2.  After this branch was created, the initial check-ins to
        enable Unix DCPM to the schedd were undone on the trunk, since
        they were creating too many problems.

3/11/99 son-of-vics-branch
        New branch for Vic Zandy to do his process hijacking work on.
        The vics-branch was abandonded since there were so many
        changes on the trunk that it would be hell to merge back in. 

3/11/99 new-syscall-branch
        New branch for Doug Thain's re-do of remote syscalls, file
        table stuff, buffering, etc. 

3/9/99  V6_1-pre-merge-V6_1_4
        The trunk, before merging in the V6_1_3-branch, which contains
        both V6_1_3 and V6_1_4.  We're merging from where V6_1_4 is
        tagged. 

3/3/99  V6_1_4
        Version 6.1.4, tagged on the V6_1_3-branch.  Almost
        exclusively bug fixes to V6_1_3, including the fix to the
        fatal FPE exception caused by uninitialized memory in Cedar. 

2/26/99 V6_1_3
        Version 6.1.3, tagged on the V6_1_3-branch.  Lots of SMP bug
        fixes, but lots of other new, unstable features.

2/?/99  V6_1_3-branch
        Branch to get 6.1.3 ready for release.

1/13/99 V6_1-pre-merge-V6_1_2
        The trunk, before merging in the V6_1_1-branch, which contains
        both V6_1_1 and V6_1_2.  We're merging from where V6_1_2 is
        tagged. 

1/12/99 V6_1_2
        Most directories are tagged on the V6_1_1-branch, with some
        bug fixes and improvements after the V6_1_1 release was
        tagged.  However, V6_1_2 includes the trunk versions of
        condor_dagman and the pvm directories:
        condor_(shadow|starter).jim.  

?/?/98 V6_1_1
        Version 6.1.1, tagged on the V6_1_1 branch.

12/21/98 V6_1_1-branch
        Branch for the V6_1_1 development series release.  Only src is
        tagged, not config.

?/?/98 V6_1-NewAds-branch

12/9/98 V6_1_0
