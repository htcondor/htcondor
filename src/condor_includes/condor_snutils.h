/* Some platforms don't have a proper snprintf(). On Windows, _snprintf()
 * doesn't NULL-terminate the buffer if the formated string is too large
 * to fit. On HP-UX, snprintf() returns -1 if the formated string is too
 * large to fit in the buffer.
 *
 * For these platforms, we provide our own snprintf(). Thus, on all
 * platforms, we guarantee that snprintf() NULL-terminates the destination
 * buffer in all cases and returns the number of bytes (excluding the
 * terminating NULL) that would have been written if the buffer had been
 * large enough.
 *
 * We also provide [v]printf_length(), which returns the number of bytes
 * (excluding the terminating NULL) necessary to hold the formatted
 * string. vprintf_length() uses a copy of the va_list passed in as a
 * convenience to the calling function.
