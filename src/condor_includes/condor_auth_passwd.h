/** A class to implement the AKEP2 protocol for password-based authentication.
 
  Refer to _The Handbook of Applied Cryptography_, Menezes, et. al.,
  fifth printing, p. 499, section 12.20, for more info on the AKEP2 protocol used
  here.  The protocol uses 1 1/2 round trips for a total of three
  messages.  ISBN number 0-8493-8523-7.  Note this book is available online
  at URL http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/.

  An overview of the protocol follows:

    SUMMARY: A and B exchange 3 messages to derive a session key W.

    RESULT: mutual entity authentication, and implicit key authentication of W.

        1. Setup: The pool sets up a long-term symmetric master key, M.  kdfM is a keyed
        derivation function from key K.  seed_a and seed_b are fixed, compile-time seeds.
        For some text message t, the keys K and K' are generated by

          K = kdfM(seed_a, t)
          K' = kdfM(seed_b, t)

        The client (A) is assumed to either have access to M or to both K and K'.  In the
        latter case, (A) does not have access to M and B may reject the key K if text t
        indicates the derived key K / K' is too old or invalid.
        hK is a MAC (keyed hash function) used for entity
        authentication.  kdfK' is a pseudorandom permutation or keyed
        one-way function used for key derivation.

    2. Protocol messages.  Define  T = (B, A, rA, rB).
        A -> B : A, t, rA               (1)
        A <- B : T, hK(T)               (2)
        A -> B : (A, rB), hK(A, rB)     (3)
        W = kdfK'(rB)

    3. Protocol actions. Perform the following steps for each shared key required.

    (a) A selects and sends to B a random number rA.

    (b) B selects a random number rB and sends to A the values (B,A,t,rA,rB), along
    with a MAC over these quantities generated using h with key K.

    (c) Upon receiving message (2), A checks the identities are proper, that the
    rA received matches that in (1), and verifies the MAC.

    (d) A then sends to B the values (A,rB), along with a MAC thereon.

    (e) Upon receiving (3), B verifies that the MAC is correct, and that the received
    value rB matches that sent earlier.

    (f) Both A and B compute the session key as W = kdfK'(rB).

  As a result of this exchange, A and B have:
    1.  Demonstrated possession of keys K and K' (which were derived from the master key M, but
        does not demonstrate either have possession of M).
    2.  From using a strong KDF, we assume this demonstrates text t was used to derive keys
        K and K'.
    3.  Does not transfer any key in the clear.
    4.  Generated a mutual session key W, generated from K'.
  Note that this protocol does NOT guarantee forward secrecy: anyone with a record of the
  conversation that, at some point in the future, acquires key M (or K and K') may also
  generate the session key W.
