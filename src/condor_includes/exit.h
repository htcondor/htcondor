	shouldn't be there, but that story is for another time), we can't
	be totally sure that the exit values with low numbers will mean
	what we think they mean. So I'm offsetting the exit codes from the
	shadow so that we know for sure(relatively anyway) what happened.
	Any exit code less than the offset should be treated as a shadow
	exception. Please make sure you don't roll over 255 in the return
