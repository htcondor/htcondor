Take any pathname -- simple, relative, or complete -- and split it
into a directory and a file name.   Always succeeds, but return
code gives some information about the path actually present.
Returns true if there was a directory component to split off.
Returns false if there was no directory component, but in this case,
still fills "dir" with "."
The buffers dir and file must be as big as path.  They are not allocated
by this function.
