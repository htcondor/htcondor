// When condor_ssh_to_job runs, the condor_starter spawns the system
// sshd with the non-root uid and euid of the job.  On some systems
// the password entry for this id doesn't exist, doesn't have a valid
// shell, or whose shell isn't in /etc/shells.  In that case, the sshd
// fails.  To prevent this, HTCondor can force the following implementation
// of getpwnam into the sshd process that defines a valid shell and user name
// 
// Not this doesn't allow a privilege escalation, as the whole thing runs
// as the user, and condor allows the job to run any binary it wants to
// begin with.
//
// The function is only forced into the sshd binary, not the job itself.
// One could argue this is a bug.
