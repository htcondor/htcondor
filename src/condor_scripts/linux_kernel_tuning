##
## This script tunes Linux kernel parameters useful for scaling HTCondor.
## Some values may be inappropriate for machines not dedicated to HTCondor.
## This script must be run as root, and we assume that (and support only)
## HTCondor is running as root for large installations.
##
## The next '##' sections marks the beginning of the implementation section
## of this script, and you should not need to change anything past that mark.
##

#
# This script logs its actions to syslog.  If you'd rather it didn't,
# change the line below to something like '/bin/true'.
#
LOGGER='/usr/bin/logger -t htcondor'

#
# Increase the global number of file descriptors.  For example, each
# dynamically-linked shadow uses approximately 13 just to open its
# libraries.
#
# We don't set the per-process maximum, because HTCondor will do that
# appropriately for each different subsystem (daemon) when run as root.
# If necessary, you can change those values using the configuration variables
# MAX_FILE_DESCRIPTORS and <SUBSYS>_MAX_FILE_DESCRIPTORS.
#
# This should match LimitNOFILE in the condor.service file for systemd
#
GLOBAL_MAX_FDS=32768

#
# Increase the maximum process ID.  By default, Linux process IDs wrap at
# 32768, which isn't a lot of processes when you have one per running job.
#
# This should match the TasksMax in the condor.service file for systemd
#
GLOBAL_MAX_PROCESSES=4194303

#
# Unless otherwise specified, an outbound connection uses a port within
# this range.  On some systems, this default to 1024-4999, which may not
# be enough.  You can also force HTCondor to specify a particular
# outbound port by setting the configuration variables OUT_LOWPORT and
# OUT_HIGHPORT appropriately, but this will be slower under load, as
# HTCondor has to search for an open port.
#
LOCAL_PORT_RANGE="1024 65535"

#
# Increase the length of the TCP listen queue.  This allows more connections
# to pile up while HTCondor is otherwise busy.
#
TCP_LISTEN_QUEUE=1024

#
# Likewise, the central manager (collector) needs have large UDP buffers.
# Increase the maximum allowed size of networks receive buffers.
#
MAX_RECEIVE_BUFFER=10485760

# Maximum amount of dirty filesystem bytes to buffer in the kernel
# before processes writing to the filesystem are blocked, and made
# to do their own i/o synchronously.  Set to 0 to undo.
# If we are running with cgroups on, there's a Linux kernel bug
# that causes spurious OOM events sent to a cgroup with a hard memory limit
# if it writes a lot of data to the filesystem quickly.  Limitting
# the buffering to 100M works around the problem
DIRTY_BYTES=100000000

# Set root user quota for max number of kernel session keys and
# bytes.  Kernel session keys are used by Kerberos, AFS, ecryptfs, and
# other services.  The condor_master creates a new session keyring by
# default on startup (via config knob DISCARD_SESSION_KEYRING_ON_STARTUP)
# so that Kerberos tokens and the like are not leaked to user jobs, and
# also to support encrypted execute directories.  The default quota
# starting with RHEL 6.4 is 1M keys and 25M bytes, which is plenty
# big.  But older kernels (like what shipped in RHEL 6.0) have a crazy
# small quota of 200 keys.  So here we just set these params to what
# RHEL 6.4+ use by default just in case people try to use HTCondor on
# an earlier kernel.
ROOT_MAXKEYS=1000000
ROOT_MAXKEYS_BYTES=25000000
