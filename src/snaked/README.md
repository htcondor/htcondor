Config Magic
------------

    SNAKED          = $(SBIN)/condor_snaked
    SNAKED_LOG      = $(LOG)/SnakeLog
    SNAKE_PATH      = $(LIB)/python3:$(ETC)/snake.d
    DAEMON_LIST     = $(DAEMON_LIST), SNAKED

Further Setup
-------------

Create ``$(ETC)/snake.d/snake/__init__.py`` and fill it with:

    from pathlib import Path

    def handleCommand(command_int):
        p = Path("/tmp") / "snake.out"
        p.write_text(f"handled command int {command_int}\n")

where ``"/tmp"`` is subject to change and ``"handled ..."`` should be,
to make sure I'm not cheating. :)

Demo
----

Run ``condor_master``.  Look at ``SnakeLog``; copy its command socket
sinful.  Run ``condor_status -direct '<sinful>'``; it will fail, but
you should now have a file, ``/tmp/snake.out``, that was generated by the
``handleCommand()`` function.
