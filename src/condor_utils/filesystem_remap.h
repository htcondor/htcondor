/**
 * Represents a set of mappings to perform on the filesystem.
 *
 * Contains a mapping of source directories that will be remounted to destinations.
 * So, if we have the mapping (/var/lib/condor/execute/1234) -> (/tmp), this class
 * will perform the equivalent of this command:
 *    mount --bind /var/lib/condor/execute/1234 /tmp
 * This is meant to give Condor the ability to provide per-job temporary directories.
 *
 * The class does two special things:
 *   1) For each remapping, if the parent mount is marked as shared-subtree, remount
 *      it first as non-shared-subtree.  This prevents remappings we make from
 *      escaping to the parent.
 *   2) Promote each autofs mount to shared-subtree.  Autofs is not aware of
 *      namespaces and when a job accesses the mount point in the job's namespaces,
 *      autofs will do the real mount in the *parent* namespace, so the job cannot
 *      access it unless we do the shared-subtree trick.
 *
