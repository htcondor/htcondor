// Ths class manages sets of Linux processes with cgroups.
// This is efficient, so we do it in the caller's process,
// not via the procd.
//
// This requires that any sub-families of this family
// are managed by cgroups and those cgroups are children
// of this one, so that we can measure the family tree
// in one cgroup call, as well as signal them all.

// ProcAPI -- a retro design doc
// The root class is ProcFamilyInterface.  It has a static factory
// method, ::create, which is called from daemon core::Create_Process
// to decide which of two concrete classes to instantiate, either
// ProcFamilyDirect or ProcFamilyProxy, the latter of which talks
// to the ProcD daemon.  This decision is done early, mainly
// looking at the USE_PROCD knob.
//
// Once DaemonCore has a ProcFamily[Direct|Proxy] instance
// it keeps it for the lifetime of the process.
//
// When a DaemonCore client wants to track a family of
// processes it creates, it passes in a familyInfo to 
// DC::Create_Process, and daemonCore calls first
// register_subfamily on the instance, then 
// track_family_via_[env|login|cgroup|cgroup].
//
// Later calls to get usage are keyed by pid, which is
// a bit of a problem.
