#ifndef CONDOR_HOLDCODES_H
#define CONDOR_HOLDCODES_H


/* This file contains hold reason codes.

   They are stored in a reflective enum class CONDOR_HOLD_CODE via enum.h 
   (see https://tinyurl.com/yfn3auay for complete docs on Better Enums).
   The TLDR is you can use these enums as you would expect, including conversions to ints, like so:
       int code = CONDOR_HOLD_CODE::JobPolicy;
       switch (code) {
	        CONDOR_HOLD_CODE::GlobalGramError:
            ...
       }
   But you can also do a bunch more than with normal enums.  For example, you can fetch 
   the name of the enum as a string with method _to_string, and create an enum from an 
   int with _from_integral.  A pithy example using both:
       int reason_code = 1;   // code 1 is CONDOR_HOLD_CODE::UserRequest
       const char *holdstr = (CONDOR_HOLD_CODE::_from_integral(reason_code))._to_string();
       // Now holdstr = "UserRequst"
   There is a lot more, see the docs for BetterEnums at the url above.
