1.    INTRODUCTION

    The object of the Grid ASCII Helper Protocol (GAHP) is to allow the
    use of the client library or package of a grid or cloud service via
    a simple ASCII-based protocol. A process which implements GAHP is
    referred to as a GAHP server. GAHP is designed to handle both
    synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous (non-blocking) calls.

    The first GAHP specification focused on the GRAM and GASS grid
    services of the Globus Toolkit. This GAHP specification focuses on
    the ARC Compute Element (CE) grid job service.

1.1   WHY A GAHP?

    Although most grid and cloud services provide client libraries or
    modules in various languages that can be incorporated directly into
    applications that wish to use those services, there are several
    distinct advantages to using an independent GAHP server process
    instead. For instance, parts of the native API may provide only
    synchronous/blocking calls. Users who require a
    non-blocking/asynchronous interface must make use of multiple
    threads. Even if the native module is thread-safe, thread safety
    requires that _all_ modules linked into the process be both
    re-entrant and in agreement upon a threading model.
    This may be a significant barrier when trying to integrate the
    service client module into legacy non-thread-safe code, or when
    attempting to link with commercial libraries which either have no
    support for threads or define their own threading model. But because
    the GAHP server runs as a separate process, it can be easily
    implemented as a multi-threaded server, and still present an
    asynchronous non-blocking protocol. Worse yet, there may not be a
    client module available in the language of the application wishing
    to use the service. With a GAHP server, langauage choice is
    immaterial.

    GAHP facilitates the construction of multi-tier systems.  A first
    tier client can easily send ASCII commands via a socket (perhaps
    securely via an SSH or SSL tunnel) to a second tier running a GAHP
    server, allowing grid or cloud services to be consolidated at the
    second or third tier with minimal effort.

    Furthermore, GAHP, like many other simple ASCII-based protocols,
    supports the concept of component-based development independent of
    the software language used with minimal complexity. When a grid
    service has client modules available in multiple languages, those
    interfaces can look very different from each other. By using GAHP, a
    body of software could be written once with one interface and then
    subsequently utilize a GAHP server written in C, Java, or Perl --
    and said GAHP server could be running locally or as a daemon on a
    remote host.

1.2   AVAILABLE ARC CE GAHP SERVERS

    The HTCondor Project at the University of Wisconsin-Madison has
    developed an ARC CE GAHP server, written in C++, which uses pthreads 
    and libcurl to support portions of the ARC CE REST protocol.  Many 
    Unix platforms are supported.

    This GAHP is available as part of the HTCondor software distribution,
    version 9.1.0 or later.

2.0   GAHP SERVER IMPLEMENTATION

    GAHP itself, as a protocol, is independent of the underlying transport
    protocol and requires only a reliable ordered bi-directional data
    stream channel.

    A GAHP server, however, is assumed to read and respond to GAHP commands
    solely via stdin and stdout.  Should stdin to a GAHP server be closed,
    the GAHP server should immediately shutdown in a manner similar to the
    receipt of a QUIT command.  Therefore, a GAHP server can be easily
    invoked and managed via SSHD, inted, or rshd.  Software can spawn a
    local GAHP server via an interface such as POSIX.2 popen().

    Under no circumstances should a GAHP server block when issued any
    command.  All commands require a response nearly instantaneously.
    Therefore, most GAHP servers will be implemented as a multi-threaded
    process. Use of child processes or avoidance of blocking calls
    within the GAHP server are also options.

3.0   GAHP COMMANDS

    The following commands must be implemented by all GAHP servers:

        COMMANDS
        QUIT
        RESULTS
        VERSION

    The following commands may be implemented by any GAHP server:

        ASYNC_MODE_ON
        ASYNC_MODE_OFF
        RESPONSE_PREFIX

    The following commands are specific to X.509 proxy certificates,
    used for authentication with some services, including ARC CE.
    They must be implemented by an ARC CE REST GAHP server:

        INITIALIZE_FROM_FILE
        REFRESH_PROXY_FROM_FILE
        CACHE_PROXY_FROM_FILE
        USE_CACHED_PROXY
        UNCACHE_PROXY

    The following commands are specific to ARC CE and must be 
    implemented by an ARC CE REST GAHP server:

        ARC_PING
        ARC_JOB_NEW
        ARC_JOB_STATUS
        ARC_JOB_INFO
        ARC_JOB_STAGE_IN
        ARC_JOB_STAGE_OUT
        ARC_JOB_CLEAN
        ARC_DELEGATION_NEW
        ARC_DELEGATION_RENEW

3.1   CONVENTIONS AND TERMS USED IN SECTION 3.2

    The following definitions are common to all GAHP protocol documents.

    <CRLF>

        The characters carriage return and line feed (in that
        order), _or_ solely the line feed character.

    <SP>

        The space character.

    line

        A sequence of ASCII characters ending with a <CRLF>.

    [ ... ]*

        A sequence of characters (those between the square brackets) 
        that may repeat zero or more times witin a line.

    Request Line

        A request for action on the part of the GAHP server.

    Return Line

        A line immediately returned by the GAHP server upon
        receiving a Request Line.

    Result Line

        A line sent by the GAHP server in response to a RESULTS
        request, which communicates the results of a previous
        asynchronous command Request.

    S: and R:

        In the Example sections for the commands below, the prefix
        "S: " is used to signify what the client sends to the GAHP
        server.   The prefix "R: " is used to signify what the
        client receives from the GAHP server.  Note that the "S: "
        or "R: " should not actually be sent or received.

3.2   GAHP COMMAND STRUCTURE

    GAHP commands consist of three parts:

        * Request Line
        * Return Line
        * Result Line

    Each of these "Lines" consists of a variable length character
    string ending with the character sequence <CRLF>.

    A Request Line is a request from the client for action on the part of
    the GAHP server.  Each Request Line consists of a command code
    followed by argument field(s).  Command codes are a string of
    alphanumeric and underscore characters.  Upper and lower case
    alphabetic characters are to be treated identically with respect to
    command codes.  Thus, any of the following may represent the
    ASYNC_MODE_ON command:
        async_mode_on
        Async_Mode_On
        asYNc_MOde_oN
        ASYNC_MODE_ON
    In contrast, the argument fields of a Request Line are _case
    sensitive_.

    The Return Line is always generated by the server as an immediate
    response to a Request Line.  The first character of a Return Line will
    contain one of the following characters:
        S - for Success
        F - for Failure
        E - for a syntax or parse Error
    Any Request Line which contains an unrecognized or unsupported command,
    or a command with an insufficient number of arguments, will generate an
    "E" response.

    The Result Line is used to support commands that would otherwise
    block.  Any GAHP command which may require the implementation to block
    on network communication require a "request id" as part of the Request
    Line.  For such commands, the Result Line just communicates if the
    request has been successfully parsed and queued for service by the
    GAHP server.  At this point, the GAHP server would typically dispatch
    a new thread to actually service the request.  Once the request has
    completed, the dispatched thread should create a Result Line and
    enqueue it until the client issues a RESULT command.

3.3   TRANSPARENCY

    Arguments on a particular Line (be it Request, Return, or Result) are
    typically separated by a <SP>.  In the event that a string argument
    needs to contain a <SP> within the string itself, it must be escaped
    by placing a backslash ("\") in front of the <SP> character.  Thus,
    the character sequence "\ " (no quotes) must not be treated as a
    separator between arguments, but instead as a space character within a
    string argument. If a string argument contains a backslash
    character, it must be escaped by preceding it with another backslash
    character.

3.4   SEQUENCE OF EVENTS

    Upon startup, the GAHP server should output to stdout a banner string
    which is identical to the output from the VERSION command without the
    beginning "S " sequence (see example below).  Next, the GAHP server
    should wait for a complete Request Line from the client (from stdin).
    The server is to take no action until a Request Line sequence is
    received.

    There are no sequencing restrictions on the ordering of Requests in
    the GAHP API, even though some sequences may be semantically
    invalid for the underlying service. For example, attempting to
    delete a new instance before creating it. The server shall not
    produce an "E" or "F" Return Line in the event of such sequences,
    but may produce a Result Line reflecting an error from the
    underlying service.

3.5   COMMAND SYNTAX

    This section contains the syntax for the Request, Return, and Result
    line for each command. The commands common to all GAHPs are defined
    first, followed by commands specific to the GCE GAHP procotol.

3.5.1 COMMON GAHP COMMANDS

    These commands are common to all GAHP types.

    -----------------------------------------------

    COMMANDS

    List all the commands from this protocol specification which are
    implemented by this GAHP server.

    + Request Line:

        COMMANDS <CRLF>

    + Return Line:

        S <SP> <command 1> <SP> <command 2> <SP> ... <command X> <CRLF>

    + Result Line:

        None.

    -----------------------------------------------

    VERSION

    Return the version string for this GAHP.  The version string follows
    a specified format (see below).  Ideally, the version entire version
    string, including the starting and ending dollar sign ($)
    delimiters, should be a literal string in the text of the GAHP
    server executable.  This way, the Unix/RCS "ident" command can
    produce the version string.

    The version returned should correspond to the version of the
    protocol supported.

    + Request Line:

        VERSION <CRLF>

    + Return Line:

        S <SP> $GahpVesion: <SP> <major>.<minor>.<subminor> <SP>
            <build-month> <SP> <build-day-of-month> <SP>
            <build-year> <SP> <general-descrip> <SP>$ <CRLF>

        * major.minor.subminor = for this version of the
            protocol, use version x.y.z.

        * build-month = string with the month abbreviation when
            this GAHP server was built or released.  Permitted
            values are: "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun",
            "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", and "Dec".

        * build-day-of-month = day of the month when GAHP server
            was built or released; an integer between 1 and 31
            inclusive.

        * build-year = four digit integer specifying the year in
            which the GAHP server was built or released.

        * general-descrip = a string identifying a particular
            GAHP server implementation.

    + Result Line:

        None.

    + Example:

        S: VERSION
        R: S $GahpVersion: 1.0.0 Nov 26 2001 NCSA\ CoG\ Gahpd $

    -----------------------------------------------

    QUIT

    Free any/all system resources (close all sockets, etc) and terminate
    as quickly as possible.

    + Request Line:

        QUIT <CRLF>

    + Return Line:

        S <CRLF>

        Immediately afterwards, the command pipe should be closed
        and the GAHP server should terminate.

    + Result Line:

        None.

    -----------------------------------------------

    RESULTS

    Display all of the Result Lines which have been queued since the
    last RESULTS command was issued.  Upon success, the first return
    line specifies the number of subsequent Result Lines which will be
    displayed.  Then each result line appears (one per line) -- each
    starts with the request ID which corresponds to the request ID
    supplied when the corresponding command was submitted.  The exact
    format of the Result Line varies based upon which corresponding
    Request command was issued.

    IMPORTANT: Result Lines must be displayed in the _exact order_ in
    which they were queued!!!  In other words, the Result Lines
    displayed must be sorted in the order by which they were placed into
    the GAHP's result line queue, from earliest to most recent.

    + Request Line:

        RESULTS <CRLF>

    + Return Line(s):

        S <SP> <num-of-subsequent-result-lines> <CRLF>
        <reqid> <SP> ... <CRLF>
        <reqid> <SP> ... <CRLF>
        ...

        * reqid = integer Request ID, set to the value specified in
            the corresponding Request Line.

    + Result Line:

        None.

    + Example:

        S: RESULTS
        R: S 1
        R: 100 0

    -----------------------------------------------

    ASYNC_MODE_ON

    Enable Asynchronous notification when the GAHP server has results
    pending for a client. This is most useful for clients that do not
    want to periodically poll the GAHP server with a RESULTS command.
    When asynchronous notification mode is active, the GAHP server will
    print out an 'R' (without the quotes) on column one when the
    'RESULTS' command would return one or more lines. The 'R' is printed
    only once between successive 'RESULTS' commands.    The 'R' is
    also guaranteed to only appear in between atomic return lines; the
    'R" will not interrupt another command's output.

    If there are already pending results when the asynchronous results
    available mode is activated, no indication of the presence of those
    results will be given. A GAHP server is permitted to only consider
    changes to it's result queue for additions after the ASYNC_MODE_ON
    command has successfully completed. GAHP clients should issue a
    'RESULTS' command immediately after enabling asynchronous
    notification, to ensure that any results that may have been added to
    the queue during the processing of the ASYNC_MODE_ON command are
    accounted for.

    + Request Line:

        ASYNC_MODE_ON <CRLF>

    + Return Line:

        S <CRLF>

        Immediately afterwards, the client should be prepared to
        handle an R <CRLF> appearing in the output of the GAHP
        server.

    + Result Line:

        None.

    + Example:

        S: ASYNC_MODE_ON
        R: S
        S: GRAM_PING 00001 beak.cs.wisc.edu/jobmanager
        R: S
        S: GRAM_PING 00002 nostos.cs.wisc.edu/jobmanager
        R: S
        R: R
        S: RESULTS
        R: S 2
        R: 00001 0
        R: 00002 0

    Note that you are NOT guaranteed that the 'R' will not appear
    between the dispatching of a command and the return line(s) of that
    command; the GAHP server only guarantees that the 'R' will not
    interrupt an in-progress return. The following is also a legal
    example:
        S: ASYNC_MODE_ON
        R: S
        S: GRAM_PING 00001 beak.cs.wisc.edu/jobmanager
        R: S
        S: GRAM_PING 00002 nostos.cs.wisc.edu/jobmanager
        R: R
        R: S
        S: RESULTS
        R: S 2
        R: 00001 0
        R: 00002 0

        (Note the reversal of the R and the S after GRAM_PING 00002)

    -----------------------------------------------

    ASYNC_MODE_OFF

    Disable asynchronous results-available notification. In this mode,
    the only way to discover available results is to poll with the
    RESULTS command.  This mode is the default. Asynchronous mode can be
    enable with the ASYNC_MODE_ON command.

    + Request Line:

        ASYNC_MODE_OFF <CRLF>

    + Return Line:

        S <CRLF>

    + Result Line:

        None

    + Example:

        S: ASYNC_MODE_OFF
        R: S

    -----------------------------------------------

    RESPONSE_PREFIX

    Specify a prefix that the GAHP server should use to prepend every
    subsequent line of output. This may simplify parsing the output of
    the GAHP server by the client program, especially in cases where the
    responses of more one GAHP server are "collated" together.

    This affects the output of both return lines and result lines for all
    subsequent commands (NOT including this one).

    + Request Line:

        RESPONSE_PREFIX <SP> <prefix> <CRLF>

        <prefix> = an arbitrary string of characters which you want to
        prefix every subsequent line printed by the GAHP server.

    + Return Line:

        S <CRLF>

    + Result Line:

        None.

    + Example:

        S: RESPONSE_PREFIX GAHP:
        R: S
        S: RESULTS
        R: GAHP:S 0
        S: RESPONSE_PREFIX NEW_PREFIX_
        R: GAHP:S
        S: RESULTS
        R: NEW_PREFIX_S 0

    -----------------------------------------------

3.5.2 GAHP COMMANDS SPECIFIC TO X.509 PROXIES

    These commands are specific to GAHP servers that need to use X.509 
    proxy certificates to authenticate with the service. ARC CE is one 
    such service.

    -----------------------------------------------

    INITIALIZE_FROM_FILE

    Initialize the GAHP server and provide it with an X.509 proxy 
    certificate which will be used by the GAHP server for all subsequent 
    authentication with requires such a credential.

    + Request Line:

        INITIALIZE_FROM_FILE <SP> <path-to-local-proxy-file> <CRLF>

        <path-to-local-proxy-file> = a fully-qualified pathname to a
        file local to the GAHP server which contains a valid X.509
        proxy certificate.

    + Return Line:

        One of the following:

        S <CRLF>
        F <SP> <error-string> <CRLF>

        Upon success, use the "S" version; if not recognized, use the
        "F" version.

        * error_string = brief string description of the error,
            appropriate for reporting to a human end-user.

    + Result Line:

        None.

    -----------------------------------------------

    REFRESH_PROXY_FROM_FILE

    Reset the X.509 proxy certificate cached by the GAHP server, which 
    is used by the GAHP server for all subsequent authentication. This 
    command can be used to tell the GAHP server to use a different 
    credential than the one initially specified via the 
    INITIALIZE_FROM_FILE command. The intention is this command will be 
    used to refresh an about-to-expire credential used by the GAHP 
    server.

    + Request Line:

        REFRESH_PROXY_FROM_FILE <SP> <path-to-local-proxy-file> <CRLF>

        <path-to-local-proxy-file> = a fully-qualified pathname to a
        file local to the GAHP server which contains a valid X.509
        proxy certificate.

    + Return Line:

        One of the following:

        S <CRLF>
        F <SP> <error-string> <CRLF>

        Upon success, use the "S" version; if not recognized, use the
        "F" version.

        * error_string = brief string description of the error,
            appropriate for reporting to a human end-user.

    + Result Line:

        None.

    -----------------------------------------------

    CACHE_PROXY_FROM_FILE

    Read an X.509 proxy from a specified file, and store it under the 
    specified symbolic name.

    The proxy is read from the file by the specified name. Its contents
    of the proxy are persisted in memory. Subsequent changes to the file
    will not affect the stored proxy. The proxy is not persisted when 
    the GAHP server ternminates.

    The intent of this command is to allow the GAHP server to capture
    several X.509 proxies and use different proxies for different jobs.

    Other commannds (e.g. by USE_CACHED_PROXY) may later be reference
    the given cached proxy by its symbolic name.

    + Request Line:

        CACHE_PROXY_FROM_FILE <SP> <id> <SP>
            <path-to-local-proxy-file> <CRLF>

        <path-to-local-proxy-file> = a fully-qualified pathname to a
        file local to the GAHP server which contains a valid X.509
        proxy certificate.

    + Return Line:

        One of the following:

        S <CRLF>
        F <SP> <error-string> <CRLF>

        Upon success, use the "S" version; if not recognized, use the
        "F" version.

        * error_string = brief string description of the error,
            appropriate for reporting to a human end-user.

    + Result Line:

        None.

    -----------------------------------------------

    USE_CACHED_PROXY

    Sets the proxy previously cached under the specified name, as the
    "active" proxy. The active proxy will be used for all subsequent 
    actions that require authentication. It will remain active until 
    it is changed via the next invocation of USE_CACHED_PROXY.

    The proxy must have been previously cached (under the specified 
    name) using CACHE_PROXY_FROM_FILE command.

    This command allows the GAHP server to simultaneously act on behalf 
    of two or more jobs that require seperate credentials.

    + Request Line:

        USE_CACHED_PROXY <SP> <id> <CRLF>

        <id> = the symbolic name of the proxy to use

    + Return Line:

        One of the following:

3.5.3 GAHP COMMANDS SPECIFIC TO ARC CE

    The following commands are specific to the ARC CE GAHP. The Request 
    Line for all commands will include the following arguments:

    * request-ID    = a non-zero Request ID

    * service-URL   = the URL used to access the ARC CE service's 
                      REST API

    A full service URL will typically be 
    "https://arc.example.org:443/arex" (without the quotes). Only the 
    hostname is required. The GAHP server will fill in any other 
    components that are omitted.

    The following is the Return Line for all ARC CE GAHP commands unless
    otherwise specified:

    + Return Line:

        <result> <CRLF>

        * result             = the character "S" (without the quotes) for
                               the successful submission of the request
                               (meaning the request is now pending), or an
                               "E" (without the quotes) for an error
                               parsing the request or its arguments (e.g.
                               an unrecognized or unsupported command, or
                               missing or malformed arguments)

    The following is the Result Line for all commands in this section 
    unless otherwise specified.
    This is the format for all commands that experience a failure 
    (status code does not start with a '2').
    In case of success, some commands will include additional 
    information in their Result Line.

    + Result Line:

        <request-ID> <SP> <status-code> <SP> <status-msg> <CRLF>

        * request-ID    = the value specified in the corresponding 
                          Request Line

        * status-code   = three-digit status code

        * status-msg    = human-readable message related to the status 
                          code

    The status-code is the HTTP status code given by the server for this 
    command. Depending on the command, this code may be taken from the 
    HTTP response header or from inside the body of the response.
    In particular, multiple commands can sometimes be sent as a single 
    HTTP request. In this case, the status of each command is given 
    separately in the HTTP response body.
    Some of these commands require multiple HTTP requests. In this case,
    if an HTTP request fails, no further HTTP requests for the command
    should be issued and the status code of the failed request (non-2xx
    number) should be returned.
    If all requests succeed, then the status code of the last request 
    should be returned.
    In the case of a purely-local error, the status code 499 can be 
    used.
