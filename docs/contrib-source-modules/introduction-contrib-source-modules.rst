Introduction
============

Contrib modules are stand alone, separate pieces of code that work
together with HTCondor to accomplish some task. These modules are
available by following links from the wiki at
`https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/wiki <https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/wiki>`_.
Documentation for these modules is either here and identified as a
contrib module, or may be within the module itself.

Other features of HTCondor are available within the source code, but are
not compiled in to the binaries distributed. To utilize these features,
acquire the source code and build it. Enable the feature as described in
this documentation.

This chapter documents the HTCondorView Client contrib module, Quill
(available with the source code), and using HTCondor with the Hadoop
File System (available with the source code).
