Describing Workflows with DAGMan
--------------------------------

A DAGMan workflow is described in a **DAG input file**. The input file specifies
the nodes of the DAG as well as the dependencies that order the DAG.

A **node** within a DAG represents a unit of work. It contains the following:

-   **Job**: An HTCondor job, defined in a submit file.
-   **PRE script** (optional): A script that runs before the job starts.
    Typically used to verify that all inputs are valid.
-   **POST script** (optional): A script that runs after the job finishes.
    Typically used to verify outputs and clean up temporary files.

The following diagram illustrates the elements of a node -- every
node must contain a job, with an optional pre and an optional
post script.

    Start --> PREscript
    subgraph DAG Node
    PREscript --> Job
    Job --> POSTscript
    end
    Job --> End((End))
    POSTscript --> End((End))

An **edge** in DAGMan describes a dependency between two nodes. DAG edges are
directional; each has a **parent** and a **child**, where the parent node must
finish running before the child starts. Any node can have an unlimited number
of parents and children.


Example: Diamond DAG
--------------------

A simple diamond-shaped DAG, as shown in the following image is presented as a
starting point for examples. This diamond DAG contains 4 nodes.

.. mermaid::

   flowchart TD 
    A --> B & C
    B & C --> D

A very simple DAG input file for this diamond-shaped DAG is:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File name: diamond.dag

    JOB  A  A.sub
    JOB  B  B.sub
    JOB  C  C.sub
    JOB  D  D.sub
    PARENT A CHILD B C
    PARENT B C CHILD D

A set of basic commands appearing in a DAG input file is described
below.

:index:`JOB command<single: DAG input file; JOB command>`

JOB
---

The **JOB** command specifies an HTCondor job. The syntax used for each
*JOB* command is:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    JOB JobName SubmitDescriptionFileName [DIR directory] [NOOP] [DONE]

A *JOB* entry maps a *JobName* to an HTCondor submit description file.
The *JobName* uniquely identifies nodes within the DAG input file and in
output messages. Each node name, given by *JobName*, within the DAG must
be unique.

The values defined for *JobName* and *SubmitDescriptionFileName* are case
sensitive, as file names in a file system are case sensitive. The
*JobName* can be any string that contains no white space, except for the
strings *PARENT* and *CHILD* (in upper, lower, or mixed case). *JobName*
also cannot contain special characters (*'.'*, *'+'*) which are reserved
for system use.

The optional *DIR* keyword specifies a working directory for this node,
from which the HTCondor job will be submitted, and from which a *PRE*
and/or *POST* script will be run. If a relative directory is specified,
it is relative to the current working directory as the DAG is submitted.
Note that a DAG containing *DIR* specifications cannot be run in
conjunction with the *-usedagdir* command-line argument to
*condor_submit_dag*. 

The optional *NOOP* keyword identifies that the HTCondor job within the
node is not to be submitted to HTCondor. This is useful for 
debugging a complex DAG structure, by marking jobs as *NOOP* to verify
that the control flow through the DAG is correct. The *NOOP* keywords
are then removed before submitting the DAG. Any PRE and POST scripts for
jobs specified with *NOOP* are executed; to avoid running the PRE and
POST scripts, comment them out. Even though the job specified with *NOOP*
is not submitted, its submit description file must still exist.

The optional *DONE* keyword identifies a node as being already
completed. This is mainly used by Rescue DAGs generated by DAGMan
itself, in the event of a failure to complete the workflow. Users should
generally not use the *DONE* keyword. The *NOOP* keyword is more
flexible in avoiding the execution of a job within a node. 

:index:`PARENT CHILD command<single: DAG input file; PARENT CHILD command>`

PARENT/CHILD Relationships
--------------------------

The **PARENT ... CHILD ...** command specifies the dependencies within the DAG.
:index:`describing dependencies<single: DAGMan; Describing dependencies>`\ Nodes are parents
and/or children within the DAG. A parent node must be completed
successfully before any of its children may be started. A child node may
only be started once all its parents have successfully completed.

The syntax used for each dependency (PARENT/CHILD) command is

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    PARENT ParentJobName [ParentJobName2 ... ] CHILD  ChildJobName [ChildJobName2 ... ]

The *PARENT* keyword is followed by one or more *ParentJobName(s)*. The
*CHILD* keyword is followed by one or more *ChildJobName(s)*. Each child
job depends on every parent job within the line. A single line in the
input file can specify the dependencies from one or more parents to one
or more children. The diamond-shaped DAG example may specify the
dependencies with

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    PARENT A CHILD B C
    PARENT B C CHILD D

An alternative specification for the diamond-shaped DAG may specify some
or all of the dependencies on separate lines:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    PARENT A CHILD B C
    PARENT B CHILD D
    PARENT C CHILD D

As a further example, the line

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    PARENT p1 p2 CHILD c1 c2

produces four dependencies:

#. p1 to c1
#. p1 to c2
#. p2 to c1
#. p2 to c2

Node Job Submit File Contents
-----------------------------

:index:`SUBMIT-DESCRIPTION command<single: DAG input file; SUBMIT-DESCRIPTION command>`

SUBMIT-DESCRIPTION command
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In addition to declaring inline submit descriptions as part of a job, they
can be declared independently of jobs using the *SUBMIT-DESCRIPTION* command.
This can be helpful to reduce the size and readability of a .dag file when
many nodes are running the same job.

A *SUBMIT-DESCRIPTION* can be defined using the following syntax:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    SUBMIT-DESCRIPTION DescriptionName {
        # submit attributes go here
    }

An independently declared submit description must have a unique name that is
not used by any of the jobs. It can then be linked to a job as follows:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    JOB JobName DescriptionName

For example, the previous diamond.dag example could be written as follows:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File name: diamond.dag

    SUBMIT-DESCRIPTION DiamondDesc {
        executable   = /path/diamond.exe
        output       = diamond.out.$(cluster)
        error        = diamond.err.$(cluster)
        log          = diamond_condor.log
        universe     = vanilla
    }

    JOB A DiamondDesc
    JOB B DiamondDesc
    JOB C DiamondDesc
    JOB D DiamondDesc

    PARENT A CHILD B C
    PARENT B C CHILD D

Inline Submit Descriptions
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Instead of using a submit description file, you can alternatively include an
inline submit description directly inside the .dag file. An inline submit
description should be wrapped in ``{`` and ``}`` braces, with each argument
appearing on a separate line, just like the contents of a regular submit file.
Using the previous diamond-shaped DAG example, the diamond.dag file would look
like this:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

        # File name: diamond.dag

        JOB  A  {
            executable   = /path/diamond.exe
            output       = diamond.out.$(cluster)
            error        = diamond.err.$(cluster)
            log          = diamond_condor.log
            universe     = vanilla
        }
        JOB  B  {
            executable   = /path/diamond.exe
            output       = diamond.out.$(cluster)
            error        = diamond.err.$(cluster)
            log          = diamond_condor.log
            universe     = vanilla
        }
        JOB  C  {
            executable   = /path/diamond.exe
            output       = diamond.out.$(cluster)
            error        = diamond.err.$(cluster)
            log          = diamond_condor.log
            universe     = vanilla
        }
        JOB  D  {
            executable   = /path/diamond.exe
            output       = diamond.out.$(cluster)
            error        = diamond.err.$(cluster)
            log          = diamond_condor.log
            universe     = vanilla
        }
        PARENT A CHILD B C
        PARENT B C CHILD D

This can be helpful when trying to manage lots of submit descriptions, so they
can all be described in the same file instead of needed to regularly shift
between many files.

The main drawback of using inline submit descriptions is that they do not
support the ``queue`` statement or any variations thereof. Any job described 
inline in the .dag file will only have a single instance submitted.

:index:`node job submit description file<single: DAGMan; Node job submit description file>`

External File Descriptions
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Each node in a DAG may use a unique submit description file. A key
limitation is that each HTCondor submit description file must submit
jobs described by a single cluster number; DAGMan cannot deal with a
submit description file producing multiple job clusters.

Consider again the diamond-shaped DAG example, where each node job uses
the same submit description file.

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File name: diamond.dag

    JOB  A  diamond_job.sub
    JOB  B  diamond_job.sub
    JOB  C  diamond_job.sub
    JOB  D  diamond_job.sub
    PARENT A CHILD B C
    PARENT B C CHILD D

Here is a sample HTCondor submit description file for this DAG:

.. code-block:: condor-submit

    # File name: diamond_job.sub

    executable   = /path/diamond.exe
    output       = diamond.out.$(cluster)
    error        = diamond.err.$(cluster)
    log          = diamond_condor.log
    request_cpus   = 1
    request_memory = 1024M
    request_disk   = 10240K

    queue

Since each node uses the same HTCondor submit description file, this
implies that each node within the DAG runs the same job. The
``$(Cluster)`` macro produces unique file names for each job's output.
:index:`DAGParentNodeNames<single: DAGParentNodeNames; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; DAGParentNodeNames>`

The job ClassAd attribute ``DAGParentNodeNames`` is also available for
use within the submit description file. It defines a comma separated
list of each *JobName* which is a parent node of this job's node. This
attribute may be used in the **arguments** :index:`arguments<single: arguments; submit commands>`
command for all but scheduler universe jobs. For example, if the job has two
parents, with *JobName*\ s B and C, the submit description file command

.. code-block:: condor-submit

    arguments = $$([DAGParentNodeNames])

will pass the string ``"B,C"`` as the command line argument when
invoking the job.

DAGMan supports jobs with queues of multiple procs, so for example:

.. code-block:: condor-submit

    queue 500

will queue 500 procs as expected.
