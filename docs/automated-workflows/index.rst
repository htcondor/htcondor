DAGMan Workflows
================

DAGMan is a HTCondor tool that allows multiple jobs to be organized in
**workflows**, represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A DAGMan workflow
automatically submits jobs in a particular order, such that certain jobs need
to complete before others start running. This allows the outputs of some jobs
to be used as inputs for others, and makes it easy to replicate a workflow
multiple times in the future.

A simple example is a workflow that requires output from node ``A`` to become
input for node ``B``. This can be described as a DAGMan workflow as follows:

    # Example DAGMan Workflow
    NODE A produce_data.sub
    NODE B process_data.sub

    PARENT A CHILD B

    A video introducing the DAGman tool for beginners is available at

    intermediate users, is available at
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2RkdxE_ph0 .  A link to the slides is
    available in the videos' description.
