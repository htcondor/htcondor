Print Format Tables
===================

:index:`Print Format Tables`
:index:`Custom Print Format Tables`

Many HTCondor tools use a formatting engine called the ClassAd pretty
printer to display ClassAd information in a meaningful matter. Tools
that provide a **-format** or **-af/-autoformat** command line options
use those options to configure the ClassAd pretty printer in a simple
manner.

The ClassAd pretty printer can be provided a more complex configuration
via a ``Print Format Table``. A print format table can be provided to
tools that support complex configuration via the **-print-format** or
**-pr** command line option such as :tool:`condor_q`, :tool:`condor_status`,
and :tool:`condor_history`.

.. sidebar:: Syntax Keywords

    All keywords used in the print format table syntax
    must be uppercase.

    The primary keywords ``SELECT``, ``WHERE``, ``GROUP BY``,
    and ``SUMMARY`` must be the first word to appear in the
    line.


Syntax
------

A print format table consists of the following parts that must
appear in order when specified:

  1. A heading line using the ``SELECT`` keyword.
  2. Zero or more formatting lines.
  3. Optional constraint line using the ``WHERE`` keyword.
  4. Optional sort lines using the ``GROUP BY`` keyword.
  5. Optional summary line using the ``SUMMARY`` keyword.

Any lines beginning with ``#`` will be treated as a comment.

.. sidebar:: String Handling

    Some keywords are to be followed up by a string denoted
    as ``<string>``. If the provided text begins with a single
    or double quote, then the string continues until the next
    matching quote (i.e. ``'All in the string'``). Strings that
    do not begin with a quote will continue until the next
    space or tab.

    Any ``\n``, ``\r``, or ``\t`` will be converted into a
    newline, carriage return, or tab character respectively.


SELECT Line
~~~~~~~~~~~

A print format table must begin with the ``SELECT`` keyword. This
keyword can be followed by options to qualify the type of query,
the global formatting options, and whether or not there will be
column headings.

``SELECT [Query Type] [Details] [Separators]``

The optional ``Query Type`` qualifier have the following keywords:

  ``FROM AUTOCLUSTER``
    Query the Schedd's default auotcluster set.

  ``UNIQUE``
    Query the Schedd for newly built autocluster based on the unique
    count of provided attributes.

  .. note::

    The ``Query Type`` qualifiers only work for :tool:`condor_q`\.

The optional ``Details`` qualifier has the following keywords:

  ``NOTITLE``
    Disable the title such as the Schedd name from :tool:`condor_q`\.

  ``NOHEADER``
    Disable column headers.

  ``NOSUMMARY``
    Disable the summary output such as the totals by job stats that
    :tool:`condor_q` displays by default.

  ``BARE``
    Shorthand for ``NOTITLE NOHEADER NOSUMMARY``.

The optional ``Separators`` qualifier has the following keywords:

  ``LABEL [SEPARATOR <string>]``
    Use item labels rather than column headers. Labels are separated
    by ``=`` unless defined by ``SEPARATOR <string>``.

  ``RECORDPREFIX <string>``
    Print ``<string>`` before each ClassAd. Empty by default.

  ``RECORDSUFFIX <string>``
    Print ``<string>`` after each ClassAd. A newline by default.

  ``FIELDPREFIX <string>``
    Print ``<string>`` before each ClassAd attribute or expression.
    Empty by default.

  ``FIELDSUFFIX <string>``
    Print ``<string>`` after each ClassAd attribute or expression.
    A single space by default.


Formatting Lines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Zero or more lines specifying a ClassAd attribute or expression and
formatting details to display as a column in the tools output. The
first valid keyword ends the ClassAd expression.

``<expression> [Header] [Adjustments] [Formatting]``

The ``Header`` qualifier has the following keyword:

  ``AS <string>``
    Define label or column heading. If not present then default to
    using the provided ``<expression>``.

The ``Adjusments`` qualifier has the following keywords:

  ``WIDTH {[-]<integer> | AUTO}``
    Set the width of the column to explicit ``<integer>`` value or
    to automatically fit the largest value printed. Negative values
    cause left alignment.

  ``FIT``
    Adjust width size to fit the data, normally used with ``WIDTH AUTO``

  ``TRUNCATE``
    Truncate any data that exceeds column width.

  ``LEFT``
    Left align data within given width.

  ``RIGHT``
    Right align data within given width.

The ``Formatting`` qualifier has the following keywords:

  ``NOPREFIX``
    Do not include the ``FIELDPREFIX`` string for this field.

  ``NOSUFFIX``
    Do not include the ``FIELDSUFFIX`` string for this field.

  ``PRINTF <string>``
    Specify a `c++ printf <https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/>`_
    formatted string to print data. Additionally, the following unique
    specifiers can be specified in the printf string format:

    - ``%T``: Print an integer value as a human readable time value ``DD+hh:mm:ss``
    - ``%V``: Print timestamp into human readable format ``MM/DD hh:mm``

  ``PRINTAS <function>``
    Format data using a built-in function. See :ref:`built-in-printas-funcs`
    for list of built-in function names available for reference.

  ``OR <char>[<char>]``
    Display specified ``<char>`` for data if ``UNDEFINED``. Fill entire
    column width if ``<char>`` is doubled. ``<char>`` either be a space
    or one of the following characters ``?*.-_#0``


WHERE Line
~~~~~~~~~~

Specify a query constraint to filter what ClassAds to display
in the tools output.

``WHERE <expression>``
   Display only ClassAds where the expression ``<expression>`` evaluates to true.


GROUP BY Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Specify a sort expression to control the ordering of displayed ClassAds.

``GROUP BY <expression> [ASCENDING | DESCENDING]``
    Sort ClassAds by evaluating ``<expression>`` in optional ``ASCENDING``
    or ``DESCENDING`` order.

Multiple sort keys can be specified in the lines following the line
that declares ``GROUP BY``.

.. code-block:: printf-table

    GROUP BY
        Owner
        ClusterId DESCENDING


SUMMARY Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Specify whether or not to display a summary table in the output.
The summary table can also be disabled using ``NOSUMMARY`` or ``BARE``
keywords in the ``SELECT`` line.

``SUMMARY [STANDARD | NONE]``
   Enable or disable the summary.

Built-in PRINTAS Functions
--------------------------

The following function names can be used with the ``PRINTAS`` keyword
to format data. Some functions implicitly use the value of specific
attributes regardless of the data produced from the evaluated expression.

``ACTIVITY_CODE``
    Render a two character  code from the :ad-attr:`State` and :ad-attr:`Activity`
    attributes of the machine ad. For example, this function would return
    ``Ci`` if the :ad-attr:`State` ``Claimed`` and the :ad-attr:`Activity`
    was ``Idle``.

    The letter codes for :ad-attr:`State` are:

        =  ===========

        0  None
        i  Idle
        b  Busy
        r  Retiring

``GRID_JOB_ID``
    Render the job id of a grid universe job extracted from :ad-attr:`GridJobId`.

``GRID_RESOURCE``

    For ec2 jobs the host will be the value of :ad-attr:`EC2RemoteVirtualMachineName`.

``GRID_STATUS``
    Render the :ad-attr:`GridJobStatus` for a grid universe job. If the attribute
