Upgrading from a 9.0 LTS release of HTCondor to a 10.0 LTS release will bring
new features introduced in the 9.x releases of HTCondor. These new
features include the following (note that this list contains only the
most significant changes; a full list of changes can be found in the
version history: \ `Version 9 Feature Releases <../version-history/development-release-series-91.html>`_):

Upgrading from a 9.0 LTS release of HTCondor to a 10.0 LTS release will also
introduce changes that administrators and users of sites running from an
older HTCondor version should be aware of when planning an upgrade. Here
is a list of items that administrators should be aware of.

- The semantics of undefined user job policy expressions has changed.  A
  policy whose expression evaluates to undefined is now uniformly ignored,
  instead of either putting the job on hold or treated as false.
