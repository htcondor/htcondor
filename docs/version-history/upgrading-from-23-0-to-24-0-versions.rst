Upgrading from an 23.0 LTS version to an 24.0 LTS version of HTCondor
=====================================================================

:index:`items to be aware of<single: items to be aware of; upgrading>`

Upgrading from a 23.0 LTS version of HTCondor to a 24.0 LTS version will bring
new features introduced in the 23.x versions of HTCondor. These new
features include the following (note that this list contains only the
most significant changes; a full list of changes can be found in the
version history: \ `Version 23 Feature Releases <../version-history/feature-versions-23-x.html>`_):

- Much improved disk usage tracking and enforcement is now available
  when using the Logical Volume manager. Also, the execute directories
  can be encrypted. See :ref:`LVM Description` for more information.
  :jira:`1783`
  :jira:`2558`

- Additions to the :tool:`htcondor` CLI tool.

  - Add nouns ``server,`` ``ap,`` and ``cm`` that take a ``status`` verb.
    :jira:`2580`
  - Add ``credential`` verb to allow user management of job credentials.
    :jira:`2483`
  - Add htcondor job ``out``, ``err``, and ``log`` verbs.
    :jira:`2182`

- Add support for tracking and enforcing CPU and memory utilization using
  cgroups version 2.

- On execution points using cgroups, jobs can only see GPUs that have been
  assigned to that job.

- DAGMan can now produce job credentials when submitting directly to
  the *condor_schedd*.
  :jira:`1711`

- :tool:`condor_q` ``-better-analyze`` now emits the units for memory and
  disk.
  :jira:`2333`

- Added new submit commands for constraining GPU properties. When these commands
  are use the ``RequireGPUs`` expression is generated automatically by submit and
  desired values are stored as job attributes. The new submit commands are :subcom:`gpus_minimum_memory`,
  :subcom:`gpus_minimum_runtime`, :subcom:`gpus_minimum_capability` and :subcom:`gpus_maximum_capability`.
  :jira:`2201`

- New implementations of the Python bindings, ``htcondor2`` and ``classad2``. This
  re-implementation of the Python bindings fixes short-comings in the original
  implementation and eases future maintenance. Users are encouraged to transition
  to this new version of the Python bindings.

- New default security configuration which allows READ-level commands to be performed
  without authentication but with encryption and integrity.

- Multiple improvements that significantly reduced CPU and memory usage on the Central Manager.

Upgrading from a 23.0 LTS version of HTCondor to a 24.0 LTS version will also
introduce changes that administrators and users of sites running from an
older HTCondor version should be aware of when planning an upgrade. Here
is a list of items that administrators should be aware of.

- The old job router route language (i.e. configuration macros
  JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS, JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES,
  JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES_FILE, and JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES_CMD)
  is no longer supported and will be removed during the
  lifetime of the **V24** feature series.
  The new route language (configuration macros :macro:`JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_<name>`,
  :macro:`JOB_ROUTER_TRANSFORM_<name>` :macro:`JOB_ROUTER_PRE_ROUTE_TRANSFORM_NAMES`,
  and :macro:`JOB_ROUTER_POST_ROUTE_TRANSFORM_NAMES`) should be used instead.
  :jira:`2259`

- The ClassAd language no longer supports unit suffixes on numeric literals.
  This was almost always a cause for confusion and bugs in ClassAd expressions.
  Note that unit suffixes are still allowed in the submit language in
  :subcom:`request_disk` and :subcom:`request_memory`, but not in arbitrary
  ClassAd expressions.
  :jira:`2455`

- The use of multiple :subcom:`queue` statements in a single submit description
  file is now deprecated. This functionality is planned to be removed during the
  lifetime of the **V24** feature series.
  :jira:`2338`

- The C++ library `libcondorapi.a` for reading events from the event log files
  is no longer shipped with HTCondor.  We know of no users of this library, and
  any new users are strongly encouraged to use the Python bindings to read
  event logs.

- When using the PASSWORD authentication method, the authenticated identity
  has been changed from `condor_pool@<UID_DOMAIN>` to `condor@password`.
  If you have ALLOW or DENY authorization rules for the former, you will
  need to change them to the latter.
  :jira:`2486`
