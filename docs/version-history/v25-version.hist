*** 25.3.0 features

- :tool:`condor_watch_q` will now display for total number of jobs for
  clusters using late materialization.
  :jira:`3164`

- Docker universe jobs now correctly report CPU and memory usage when the
  docker server is installed in a non-standard place, pointed at with 
  the DOCKER_HOST environment variable, such as with a docker-in-docker setup.
  :jira:`3280`

- Removed option to have the *condor_schedd* send claim lease keep-alives.
  Now, the *condor_startd* always sends the keep-alives, which was the
  default.
  :jira:``3312

- Add a python bindings function to reload the ClassAd usermaps and to load
  a specific usermap for use with the ``userMap`` ClassAd function.
  :jira:`3274`

*** 25.3.0 bugs

*** 25.0.3 bugs

- Fixed a bug where :tool:`condor_history` could take many minutes to read a single line
  from the history file when the line is many megabytes long. This was causing
  ingestion of epoch ads into a database to timeout.
  :jira:`3299`

- Fixed a very longstanding bug where extremely fast machines would
  overflow a 32 bit counter and return -1 for the :ad-attr:`KFlops`
  slot attribute.
  :jira:`3288`

*** 25.2.0 features

- A job can now specify both an initial value for :subcom:`request_memory`
  and a retry with a larger memory request if job uses more memory than the initial request.
  The default value for :subcom:`request_memory` and for :subcom:`request_disk`
  have been changed so that jobs will no longer default to trying to grow the request
  based on previous usage.
  :jira:`3227`

- Improved DAGMan to allow :dag-cmd:`SUBMIT-DESCRIPTION`\'s to be declared
  after nodes that reference the named inline submit description.
  :jira:`3230`

- DAGMan will now output a structured message for job submission failures
  to the debug log file. This message is formatted similarly to the read
  userlog job event message.
  :jira:`3257`

- Added new DAGMan Post :dag-cmd:`SCRIPT` macro to provide exit code for each
  job associated with a node. This is in the form of a comma separated list.
  :jira:`3245`

- Added new fine grained attributes :ad-attr:`NumPendingClaimsInQueue` and
  :ad-attr:`NumPendingClaimsInContact` to the *condor_schedd* record.
  :jira:`3125`

- The *condor_credmon_local* can now use RSA-based (RS256) keys to generate
  tokens by setting :macro:`LOCAL_CREDMON_PRIVATE_KEY_ALGORITHM` to ``RS256``.
  :jira:`3266`

- Added the ability to set a ClassAd expression in
  :macro:`LOCAL_CREDMON_AUTHZ_TEMPLATE_EXPR` to define scopes for tokens
  generated by the *condor_credmon_local*.
  :jira:`3261`

*** 25.2.0 bugs

- Fixed a problem where setting :macro:`MAX_FILE_TRANSFER_PLUGIN_LIFETIME`
  to longer than :macro:`STARTER_FILE_XFER_STALL_TIMEOUT` would prevent the
  logging the output of hung file-transfer plug-ins.
  :jira:`3202`

*** 25.0.2 bugs

- Fixed bug where when :macro:`SINGULARITY_TARGET_DIR` was set and
  :macro:`STARTER_NESTED_SCRATCH` was also set, then some environment
  variables that pointed into the job's execute directory were not correct.
  :jira:`3265`

- Fixed a bug causing some file-transfer plug-ins (box, gdrive, and onedrive)
  to fail immediately on start-up.
  :jira:`3317`

*** 25.1.0 features

*** 25.1.0 bugs

*** 25.0.1 features

- New implementations of the Python bindings, ``htcondor2`` and ``classad2``. This
  re-implementation of the Python bindings fixes short-comings in the original
  implementation and eases future maintenance.
  :jira:`2153`

- The original implementation of the Python bindings has been removed.
  To use the new Python bindings, please read the
  :doc:`migration guide <../apis/python-bindings/api/version2/migration-guide>`.
  :jira:`3240`

*** 25.0.1 bugs

- Fixed a bug where *condor_qusers* would treat the ``add`` option as ``enable``
  when the leading dash was omitted.
  :jira:`3284`
