Version 10.0 LTS Releases
=========================

These are Long Term Support (LTS) versions of HTCondor. As usual, only bug fixes
(and potentially, ports to new platforms) will be provided in future
10.0.y versions. New features will be added in the 10.x.y feature versions.

The details of each version are described below.

.. _lts-version-history-1008:

Version 10.0.8
--------------

Release Notes:

.. HTCondor version 10.0.8 released on Month Date, 2023.

- HTCondor version 10.0.8 not yet released.

New Features:

- None.

Bugs Fixed:

- Fixed a bug in DAGMan where service nodes that finish before the DAGs
  end would result in DAGMan crashing due to an assertion failure.
  :jira:`1909`

- When the file transfer queue is growing too big, HTCondor sends email to the
  administrator.  Prior versions of HTCondor would send an arbitrarily large number
  of emails.  Now HTCondor will only send one email per day.
  :jira:`1937`

- Preen now preserves all files in the spool directory matching `*OfflineLog*`
  so that central managers with multiple active collectors can have offline
  ads.
  :jira:`1933`


.. _lts-version-history-1007:

Version 10.0.7
--------------

Release Notes:

.. HTCondor version 10.0.7 released on Month Date, 2023.

- HTCondor version 10.0.7 not yet released.

New Features:

- The ``-summary`` option of *condor_config_val* now works with a remote
  config query when the daemon being queried is 10.0.7 or later. It behaves
  like ``-dump`` when the daemon is older.
  :jira:`1879`

- Improved daemon logging for IDTOKENS authentication to make useful
  messages more prominent.
  :jira:`1776`

Bugs Fixed:

- Fixed a bug where if the $(SPOOL) directory was on a separate file system
  *condor_preen* could delete the special 'lost+found' directory.
  :jira:`1906`

- If the collector is storing offline ads via COLLECTOR_PERSISTENT_AD_LOG
  the *condor_preen* tool will no longer delete that file
  :jira:`1874`

- Print detailed error message when *condor_remote_cluster* fails to
  fetch a URL.
  :jira:`1884`

- Fixed bug where condor cron jobs put on hold by the *condor_shadow*
  or *condor_starter* would never start running again and stay ``IDLE``
  when released from the ``HELD`` state.
  :jira:`1869`

- Fixed a bug when creating the default value for :macro:`DC_DAEMON_LIST` where a
  secondary daemon such as ``COLLECTOR01`` would not be considered a DC daemon if
  the primary daemon was not in :macro:`DAEMON_LIST`.
  :jira:`1900`

- Fixed a bug that caused *condor_preen* to crash if configuration
  parameter ``PREEN_COREFILE_MAX_SIZE`` was set to a value larger than
  2 gigabytes.
  :jira:`1908`

- Remove limit on certificate chain length in SSL authentication.
  :jira:`1904`

.. _lts-version-history-1006:

Version 10.0.6
--------------

Release Notes:

- HTCondor version 10.0.6 released on June 22, 2023.

New Features:

- Added configuration parameter :macro:`AUTH_SSL_USE_CLIENT_PROXY_ENV_VAR`,
  which controls whether the client checks the environment variable
  `X509_USER_PROXY` for the location of a credential to use during SSL
  authentication with a daemon.
  :jira:`1841`

- During SSL authentication, when the client uses a proxy certificate,
  the server now uses the End Entity certificate's subject as the
  authenticated identity to map, instead of the proxy certificate's
  subject.
  :jira:`1866`

Bugs Fixed:

- Fixed a bug in the python bindings where some attributes were
  omitted from accounting ads queried from the *condor_negotiator*.
  :jira:`1780`

- Fixed a bug in the python bindings where an incorrect version was
  being reported.
  :jira:`1813`

- The classad functions ``anycompare``, ``allcompare``, ``sum``, ``min``,
  ``max``, ``avg`` and ``join`` no longer treat a single undefined input
  as forcing the result to be undefined.  ``sum``, ``min``, ``max``, ``avg`` and ``join``
  will skip over undefined inputs, while ``anycompare`` and ``allcompare`` will compare
  them correctly.
  :jira:`1799`

- The submit commands **remote_initialdir**, **transfer_input**,
  **transfer_output**, and **transfer_error** now work properly when
  submitting a **batch** grid universe job to a remote system via ssh.
  :jira:`1560`

- Fixed bug in ``condor_pool_job_report`` script that broke the script and
  outputted error messages about invalid constraint expressions due internal
  use of ``condor_history`` specifying a file to read with ``-f`` flag instead
  of full ``-file``.
  :jira:`1812`
  
- Fixed a bug where the *condor_startd* would sometimes not remove docker images
  that had been left behind when a *condor_starter* exited abruptly.
  :jira:`1814`

- *condor_store_cred* and *condor_credmon_vault* now reuses existing
  Vault tokens when down scoping access tokens.
  :jira:`1527`

- Fixed a missing library import in *condor_credmon_vault*.
  :jira:`1527`

- When started on a systemd system, HTCondor will now wait for the SSSD
  service to start.  Previously it only waited for ypbind.
  :jira:`1829`

.. _lts-version-history-1005:

Version 10.0.5
--------------

Release Notes:

- HTCondor version 10.0.5 released on June 9, 2023.

- Renamed the ``upgrade9to10checks.py`` script to ``condor_upgrade_check``
  to match standard HTCSS naming scheme.
  :jira:`1828`

New Features:

- None.

Bugs Fixed:

- Fix spurious warning from ``condor_upgrade_check`` for regular expressions that contain a space.
  :jira:`1840`

- ``condor_upgrade_check`` no longer attempts to check for problems
  for an HTCondor pool when requesting checks for an HTCondor-CE.
  :jira:`1840`

.. _lts-version-history-1004:

Version 10.0.4
--------------

Release Notes:

- HTCondor version 10.0.4 released on May 30, 2023.

- Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) is no longer supported, since its end of life
  is April 30th, 2023.

- Preliminary support for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa) on PowerPC (ppc64le).
  :jira:`1668`

New Features:

- Added new script called ``upgrade9to10checks.py`` to help administrators check
  for known issues that exist and changes needed for an HTCondor system when
  upgrading from ``V9`` to ``V10``. This script checks for three well known
  breaking changes: changing of the default value for :macro:`TRUST_DOMAIN`,
  changing to using ``PCRE2`` for regular expression matching, and changes
  to how users request GPUs.
  :jira:`1658`

- Added configuration parameter :macro:`AUTH_SSL_ALLOW_CLIENT_PROXY`,
  which allows the client to present an X.509 proxy certificate during
  SSL authentication with a daemon.
  :jira:`1781`

- Added ``CONFIG_ROOT`` configuration variable that is set to the directory
  of the main configuration file before the configuration files are read.
  :jira:`1733`

- Ensure that the SciTokens library can create its cache of token
  issuer credentials.
  :jira:`1757`

Bugs Fixed:

- Fixed a bug where certain errors during file transfer could result in
  file-transfer processes not being cleaned up.  This would manifest as
  jobs completing successfully, including final file transfer, but ending
  up without one of their output files (the one the error occurred during).
  :jira:`1687`

- Fixed a bug where the *condor_schedd* falsely believed there were
  too many jobs in the queue and rejected new job submissions based on
  ``MAX_JOBS_SUBMITTED``.
  :jira:`1688`

- Fix a bug where SSL authentication would fail when using a daemon's
  private network address when ``PRIVATE_NETWORK_NAME`` was configured.
  :jira:`1713`

- Fixed a bug that could cause a daemon or tool to crash when
  attempting SSL or SCITOKENS authentication.
  :jira:`1756`

- Fixed a bug where the HTCondor-CE would fail to handle any of its
  jobs after a restart.
  :jira:`1755`

- Fixed a bug where Job Ad Information events weren't always written
  when using the Job Router.
  :jira:`1642`

- Fixed a bug where the submit event wasn't written to the job event
  log if the job ad didn't contain a ``CondorVersion`` attribute.
  :jira:`1643`

- Fixed a bug where a *condor_schedd* was denied authorization to send
  reschedule command to a *condor_negotiator* with the IDToken authorization
  levels recommended in the documentation for setting up a condor pool.
  :jira:`1615`

- *condor_remote_cluster* now works correctly when the hardware
  architecture of the remote machine isn't x86_64.
  :jira:`1670`

- Fixed *condor_c-gahp* and *condor_job_router* to submit jobs in the
  same way as *condor_submit*.
  :jira:`1695`

- Fixed a bug introduced in HTCondor 10.0.3 that caused remote
  submission of **batch** grid universe jobs via ssh to fail when
  attempting to do file transfer.
  :jira:`1747`

- When writing a remove event in JSON, the ``ToE.When`` field is now seconds
  since the (Unix) epoch, like all other events.
  :jira:`1763`

- Fixed a bug where DAGMan job submission would fail when not using
  direct submission due to setting a custom job ClassAd attribute with
  the ``+`` syntax in a ``VARS`` command that doesn't append the
  variables i.e. ``VARS NodeA PREPEND +customAttr="value"``
  :jira:`1771`

- The ce-audit collector plug-in should no longer crash.
  :jira:`1774`

.. _lts-version-history-1003:

Version 10.0.3
--------------

Release Notes:

- HTCondor version 10.0.3 released on April 6, 2023.

- If you set :macro:`CERTIFICATE_MAPFILE_ASSUME_HASH_KEYS` and use ``/`` to
  mark the beginning and end of a regular expression, the character sequence
  ``\\`` in the mapfile now passes a single ``\`` to the regular expression
  engine.  This allows you to pass the sequence ``\/`` to the regular
  expression engine (put ``\\\/`` in the map file), which was not previously
  possible.  If the macro above is set and you have a ``\\`` in your map file,
  you will need to replace it with ``\\\\``.
  :jira:`1573`

- For *condor_annex* users: Amazon Web Services is deprecating the Node.js
  12.x runtime.  If you ran the *condor_annex* setup command with a previous
  version of HTCondor, you'll need to update your setup.  Go to the AWS
  CloudFormation `console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/>`_
  and look for the stack named ``HTCondorAnnex-LambdaFunctions``.  (You
  may have to switch regions.)  Click on that stack's radio button, hit
  the delete button in the table header, and confirm.  Wait for the delete
  to finish.  Then run ``condor_annex -aws-region region-name-N -setup``
  for the region.  Repeat for each region of interest.
  :jira:`1627`.

New Features:

- Allow remote submission of **batch** grid universe jobs via ssh to work
  with sites that were configured with the old *bosco_cluster* tool.
  :jira:`1632`

Bugs Fixed:

- Fixed two problems with GPU metrics.  First, fixed a bug where reconfiguring
  a *condor_startd* caused GPU metrics to stop being reported.  Second, fixed
  a bug where GPU (core) utilization could be wildly over-reported.
  :jira:`1660`

- Fix bug, introduced in HTCondor version 10.0.2, that prevented new
  installations of HTCondor from working on Debian or Ubuntu.
  :jira:`1689`

- Fixed bug where a *condor_dagman* node with ``RETRY`` capabilities would instantly
  restart that node every time it saw a job proc failure. This would result in nodes
  with multi-proc jobs to resubmit the entire node multiple times causing internal
  issues for DAGMan.
  :jira:`1607`

- Fixed a rare bug in the late materialization code that could
  cause a *condor_schedd* crash.
  :jira:`1581`

- Fixed bug where the *condor_shadow* would crash during job removal.
  :jira:`1585`

- Fixed a bug where two *condor_schedd* daemons in a High Availability
  configuration could be active at the same time.
  :jira:`1590`

- Improved the HTCondor's systemd configuration to not start HTCondor until the
  system attempts (and mostly likely succeeds) to mount remote filesystems.
  :jira:`1594`

- Fixed a bug where the *condor_master* of a glidein submitted to
  SLURM via HTCondor-CE would try to talk to the *condor_gridmanager*
  of the HTCondor-CE.
  :jira:`1604`

- Fixed a bug in the *condor_schedd* that could result in the ``TotalSubmitProcs``
  attribute of a late materialization job being set to a value smaller than the
  correct value shortly after the *condor_schedd* was restarted.
  :jira:`1603`

- If a job's requested credentials are not available when the job is
  about to start, the job is now placed on hold.
  :jira:`1600`

- Fixed a bug that would cause the *condor_schedd* to hang if an
  invalid condor cron argument was submitted
  :jira:`1624`

- Fixed a bug where cron jobs put on hold due to invalid time specifications
  would be unable to be removed from the job queue with tools.
  :jira:`1629`

- Fixed how the *condor_gridmanager* handles failed ARC CE jobs.
  Before, it would endlessly re-query the status of jobs that failed
  during submission to the LRMS behind ARC CE.
  If ARC CE reports a job as FAILED because the job exited with a
  non-zero exit code, the *condor_gridmanager* now treats it as
  completed.
  :jira:`1583`

- Fixed a bug where values specified with **arc_rte** in the job's
  submit description weren't properly sent to the ARC CE service.
  :jira:`1648`

- Fixed a bug that can cause a daemon to crash during SciTokens
  authentication if the configuration parameter
  ``SCITOKENS_SERVER_AUDIENCE`` isn't set.
  :jira:`1652`

.. _lts-version-history-1002:

Version 10.0.2
--------------

Release Notes:

- HTCondor version 10.0.2 released on March 2, 2023.

- HTCondor Python wheel is now available for Python 3.11 on PyPI.
  :jira:`1586`

- The macOS tarball is now being built on macOS 11.
  :jira:`1610`

New Features:

- Added configuration option called :macro:`ALLOW_TRANSFER_REMAP_TO_MKDIR` to allow
  a transfer output remap to create directories in allowed places if they
  do not exist at transfer output time.
  :jira:`1480`

- Improved scalability of *condor_schedd* when running more than 1,000 jobs
  from the same user.
  :jira:`1549`

- *condor_ssh_to_job* should now work in glidein and other environments
  where the job or HTCondor is running as a Unix user id that doesn't
  have an entry in the /etc/passwd database.
  :jira:`1543`

- VM universe jobs are now configured to pass through the host CPU model
  to the VM. This change enables VMs with newer kernels (such as Enterprise
  Linux 9) to operate in VM Universe.
  :jira:`1559`

- The *condor_remote_cluster* command was updated to fetch the Alma Linux
  tarballs for Enterprise Linux 8 and 9.
  :jira:`1562`

Bugs Fixed:

- In the python bindings, the attribute ``ServerTime`` is now included
  in job ads returned by ``Schedd.query()`` to support Fifemon.
  :jira:`1531`

- Fixed issue when HTCondor could not be installed on Ubuntu 18.04
  (Bionic Beaver).
  :jira:`1548`

- Attempting to use a file-transfer plug-in that doesn't exist is no longer
  silently ignored.  This could happen due to different bug, also fixed, where plug-ins
  specified only in ``transfer_output_remaps`` were not automatically added
  to a job's requirements.
  :jira:`1501`

- Fixed a bug where **condor_now** could not use the resources freed by
  evicting a job if its procID was 1.
  :jira:`1519`

- Fixed a bug that caused the *condor_startd* to exit when thinpool
  provisioned filesystems were enabled.
  :jira:`1524`

- Fixed a bug causing a Python warning when installing on Ubuntu 22.04.
  :jira:`1534`

- Fixed a bug where the *condor_history* tool would crash
  when doing a remote query with a constraint expression or specified
  job IDs.
  :jira:`1564`

.. _lts-version-history-1001:

Version 10.0.1
--------------

Release Notes:

- HTCondor version 10.0.1 released on January 5, 2023.

New Features:

- Add support for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish).
  :jira:`1304`

- HTCondor now includes a file transfer plugin that support ``stash://``
  and ``osdf://`` URLs.
  :jira:`1332`

- The Windows installer now uses the localized name of the Users group
  so that it can be installed on non-English Windows platforms.
  :jira:`1474`

- OpenCL jobs can now run inside a Singularity container launched by HTCondor if the
  OpenCL drivers are present on the host in directory ``/etc/OpenCL/vendors``.
  :jira:`1410`

- The ``CompletionDate`` attribute of jobs is now undefined until such time as the job completes
  previously it was 0.
  :jira:`1393`

Bugs Fixed:

- Fixed a bug where Debian, Ubuntu and other Linux platforms with
  swap accounting disabled in the kernel would never put
  a job on hold if it exceeded RequestMemory and
  MEMORY_LIMIT_POLICY was set to hard or soft.
  :jira:`1466`

- Fixed a bug where using the ``-forcex`` option with *condor_rm*
  on a scheduler universe job could cause a *condor_schedd* crash.
  :jira:`1472`

- Fixed bugs in the container universe that prevented
  apptainer-only systems from running container universe jobs
  with Docker repository style images.
  :jira:`1412`

- Docker universe and container universe job that use the docker runtime now detect
  when the Unix uid or gid has the high bit set, which docker does not support.
  :jira:`1421`

- Grid universe **batch** works again on Debian and Ubuntu.
  Since 9.5.0, some required files had been missing.
  :jira:`1475`

- Fixed bug in the curl plugin where it would crash on Enterprise Linux 8
  systems when using a file:// url type.
  :jira:`1426`

- Fixed bug in where the multi-file curl plugin would fail to timeout
  due lack of upload or download progress if a large amount of bytes
  where transferred at some point.
  :jira:`1403`
  
- Fixed bug where the multi-file curl plugin would fail to receive a SciToken
  if it was in raw format rather than json.
  :jira:`1447`
  
- Fixed a bug that prevented the starter from properly mounting
  thinpool provisioned ephemeral scratch directories.
  :jira:`1419`

- Fixed a bug where SSL authentication with the *condor_collector* could
  fail when the provided hostname is not a DNS CNAME.
  :jira:`1443`

- Fixed a Vault credmon bug where tokens were being refreshed too often.
  :jira:`1017`

- Fixed a Vault credmon bug where the CA certificates used were not based on the
  HTCondor configuration.
  :jira:`1179`

- Fixed the *condor_gridmanager* to recognize when it has the final 
  data for an ARC job in the FAILED status with newer versions of ARC CE. 
  Before, the *condor_gridmanager* would leave the job marked as 
  RUNNING and retry querying the ARC CE server endlessly. 
  :jira:`1448`

- Fixed AES encryption failures on macOS Ventura.
  :jira:`1458`

- Fixed a bug that would cause tools that have the ``-printformat`` argument to segfault
  when the format file contained a ``FIELDPREFIX``, ``FIELDSUFFIX``, ``RECORDPREFIX`` or ``RECORDSUFFIX``.
  :jira:`1464`

- Fixed a bug in the ``RENAME`` command of the transform language that could result in a
  crash of the *condor_schedd* or *condor_job_router*.
  :jira:`1486`

- For tarball installations, the *condor_configure* script now configures
  HTCondor to use user based security.
  :jira:`1461`

.. _lts-version-history-1000:

Version 10.0.0
--------------

Release Notes:

- HTCondor version 10.0.0 released on November 10, 2022.

New Features:

- The default for ``TRUST_DOMAIN``, which is used by with IDTOKEN authentication
  has been changed to ``$(UID_DOMAIN)``.  If you have already created IDTOKENs for 
  use in your pool, you should configure ``TRUST_DOMAIN`` to the issuer value of a valid token.
  :jira:`1381`

- The *condor_transform_ads* tool now has a ``-jobtransforms`` argument that reads
  transforms from the configuration.  This provides a convenient way to test the
  ``JOB_TRANSFORM_<NAME>`` configuration variables.
  :jira:`1312`

- Added new automatic configuration variable ``DETECTED_CPUS_LIMIT`` which gets set
  to the minimum of ``DETECTED_CPUS`` from the configuration and ``OMP_NUM_THREADS``
  and ``SLURM_CPU_ON_NODES`` from the environment.
  :jira:`1307`

Bugs Fixed:

- Fixed a bug where if a job created a symbolic link to a file, the contents of
  that file would be counted in the job's `DiskUsage`.  Previously,
  symbolic links to directories were (correctly) ignored, but not symbolic links to
  files.
  :jira:`1354`

- Fixed a bug where if SINGULARITY_TARGET_DIR is set, condor_ssh_to
  job would start the interactive shell in the root directory of
  the job, not in the current working directory of the job.
  :jira:`1406`

- Suppressed a Singularity or Apptainer warning that would appear
  in a job's stderr file, warning about the inability to set the
  HOME environment variable if the job or the system explicitly tried
  to set it.
  :jira:`1386`

- Fixed a bug where on certain Linux kernels, the ProcLog would be filled
  with thousands of errors of the form  "Internal cgroup error when 
  retrieving iowait statistics".  This error was harmless, but filled
  the ProcLog with noise.
  :jira:`1385`

- Fixed bug where certain **submit file** variables like ``accounting_group`` and
  ``accounting_group_user`` couldn't be declared specifically for DAGMan jobs because
  DAGMan would always write over the variables at job submission time.
  :jira:`1277`

- Fixed a bug where SciTokens authentication wasn't available on macOS
  and Python wheels distributions.
  :jira:`1328`

- Fixed job submission to newer ARC CE releases.
  :jira:`1327`

- Fixed a bug where a pre-created security session may not be used
  when connecting to a daemon over IPv6.
  The peers would do a full round of authentication and authorization,
  which may fail.
  This primarily happened with both peers had ``PREFER_IPV4`` set to
  ``False``.
  :jira:`1341`

- The *condor_negotiator* no longer sends the admin capability
  attribute of  machine ads to the *condor_schedd*.
  :jira:`1349`

- Fixed a bug in DAGMan where **Node** jobs that could not write to their **UserLog**
  would cause the **DAG** to get stuck indefinitely while waiting for pending **Nodes**.
  :jira:`1305`

- Fixed a bug where ``s3://`` URLs host or bucket names shorter than 14
  characters caused the shadow to dump core.
  :jira:`1378`

- Fixed a bug in the hibernation code that caused HTCondor to ignore
  the active Suspend-To-Disk option.
  :jira:`1357`

- Fixed a bug where some administrator client tools did not properly
  use the remote administrator capability (configuration parameter
  ``SEC_ENABLE_REMOTE_ADMINISTRATION``).
  :jira:`1371`

- When a ``JOB_TRANSFORM_*`` transform changes an attribute at submit time in a late
  materialization factory, it no longer marks that attribute as fixed for all jobs.  This
  change makes it possible for a transform to modify rather than simply replacing an attribute
  that that the user wishes to vary per job.
  :jira:`1369`

- Fixed bug where **Collector**, **Negotiator**, and **Schedd** core files that are naturally
  large would be deleted by *condor_preen* because the file sizes exceeded the max file size.
  :jira:`1377`

- Fixed a bug that could cause a daemon or tool to crash when
  connecting to a daemon using a security session.
  This particularly affected the *condor_schedd*.
  :jira:`1372`

- Fixed a bug that could cause digits to be truncated reading resource usage information
  from the job event log via the Python or C++ APIs for reading event logs. Note this only
  happens for very large values of requested or allocated disk, memory.
  :jira:`1263`

- Fixed a bug where GPUs that were marked as OFFLINE in the **Startd** would still be available
  for matchmaking in the ``AvailableGPUs`` attribute.
  :jira:`1397`

- The executables within the tarball distribution now use ``RPATH`` to find
  shared libraries.  Formerly, ``RUNPATH`` was used and tarballs became
  susceptible to failures when independently compiled HTCondor libraries were
  present in the ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``.
  :jira:`1405`
