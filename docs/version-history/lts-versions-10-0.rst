Version 10.0.0
--------------

Release Notes:

.. HTCondor version 10.0.0 released on Month Date, 2022.

- HTCondor version 10.0.0 not yet released.

New Features:

- None.

Bugs Fixed:

- Fixed a bug where if a job created a symlink to a file, the contents of
  that file would be counted in the job's `DiskUsage`.  Previously,
  symlinks to directories were (correctly) ignored, but not symlinks to
  files.
  :jira:`1354`

- Fixed bug where certain **submit file** variables like ``accounting_group`` and
  ``accounting_group_user`` couldn't be declared specifically for DAGMan jobs because
  DAGMan would always write over the variables at job submission time.
  :jira:`1277`

- Fixed a bug where SciTokens authentication wasn't available on macOS
  and Python wheels distributions.
  :jira:`1328`

- Fixed job submission to newer ARC CE releases.
  :jira:`1327`

- Fixed a bug where a pre-created security session may not be used
  when connecting to a daemon over IPv6.
  The peers would do a full round of authentication and authorization,
  which may fail.
  This primarily happened with both peers had ``PREFER_IPV4`` set to
  ``False``.
  :jira:`1341`

- The *condor_negotiator* no longer sends the admin capability
  attribute of  machine ads to the *condor_schedd*.
  :jira:`1349`

- Fixed a bug in DAGMan where **Node** jobs that could not write to their **UserLog**
  would cause the **DAG** to get stuck indefinitely while waiting for pending **Nodes**.
  :jira:`1305`
  
- Fixed a bug in the hibernation code that caused HTCondor to ignore
  the active Suspend-To-Disk option.
  :jira:`1357`
