*** 24.5.0 features

- The *condor_starter* now advertise :ad-attr:`StdoutMtime` and :ad-attr:`StderrMtime`
  which represent the most recent modification time, in seconds since the epoch
  of a job which uses file transfer.
  :jira:`2837`

- Increased the default width of :tool:`condor_qusers` output when redirected to a
  file or piped to another command to prevent truncation.
  :jira:`2861`

- The *condor_startd* will now never lose track and leak logical volumes that were failed
  to be cleaned up when using :macro:`STARTD_ENFORCE_DISK_LIMITS`. The *condor_startd*
  will now periodically retry removal of logical volumes with an exponential backoff.
  :jira:`2852`

- The *condor_startd* will now keep dynamic slots that have a :ad-attr:`SlotBrokenReason`
  attribute in ``Unclaimed`` state rather than deleting them when they change state
  to ``Unclaimed``.  A new configuration variable :macro:`CONTINUE_TO_ADVERTISE_BROKEN_DYNAMIC_SLOTS`
  controls this behavior.  It defaults to ``true`` but can be set to ``false`` to preserve
  the old behavior.  This change also adds a new attribute :ad-attr:`BrokenContextAds`
  to the daemon ad of the *condor_startd*. This attribute has a classad for each broken resource
  in the startd.  *condor_status* has been enhanced to use this new attribute to display
  more information about the context of broken resources when both ``-startd`` and ``-broken``
  arguments are used.
  :jira:`2844`

- Added new configuration option :macro:`LVM_CLEANUP_FAILURE_MAKES_BROKEN_SLOT` to allow
  administrators to enable/disable failure of cleaning up LV's in the *condor_starter*
  to result in a broken slot.
  :jira:`2850`

- Daemons will now more quickly discover with a non-responsive
  *condor_collector* has recovered and resume advertising to it.
  :jira:`2605`

*** 24.5.0 bugs

- Fixed a bug where the *condor_gridmanager* would write to log file
  `GridmanagerLog.root` after a reconfig.
  :jira:`2846`

- ``htcondor annex shutdown`` now works again.
  :jira:`2808`

- Fixed a bug where the job state table DAGMan prints to its debug file could
  contain a negative number for the count of failed jobs.
  :jira:`2872`

*** 24.0.5 bugs

- Fixed a bug in :mod:`htcondor2` preventing the submission of jobs with
  ``FROM TABLE`` queue statements.
  :jira:`2830`

*** 24.4.0 features

- Improved validation and cleanup of :macro:`EXECUTE` directories.
  The :macro:`EXECUTE` directory must now be owned by the *condor* user
  when the daemons are started as root. The condor_startd will
  not attempt to clean an invalid :macro:`EXECUTE` directory nor will
  it alter the file permissions of an :macro:`EXECUTE` directory.
  :jira:`2789`

- For **batch** grid :subcom:`universe` jobs, the PATH environment variable values
  from the job ad and the worker node environment are now combined.
  Previously, only the PATH value from the job ad was used.
  The old behavior can be restored by setting ``blah_merge_paths=no`` in
  the ``blah.config`` file.
  :jira:`2793`

- Many small improvements to :tool:`condor_q` ``-analyze`` and ``-better-analyze``
  for pools that use partitionable slots.  As a part of this, the *condor_schedd*
  was changed to provide match information for the autocluster of
  the job being analyzed, which :tool:`condor_q` will report if it is available.
  :jira:`2720`

- The *condor_startd* now advertises a new attribute,
  :ad-attr:`SingularityUserNamespaces` which is ``true`` when apptainer
  or singularity work and are using Linux user namespaces, and ``false``
  when it is using setuid mode.
  :jira:`2818`

- The *condor_startd* daemon ad now contains attributes showing the average and total
  bytes transferred to and from jobs during its lifetime.
  :jira:`2721`

- The *condor_credd* daemon no longer listens on port ``9620`` by default,
  but rather uses the *condor_shared_port* daemon.
  :jira:`2763`

- DAGMan will now periodically print a table regarding states of
  job placed to the Access Point to the debug log (``*.dagman.out``).
  The rate at which this table in printed is dictated by
  :macro:`DAGMAN_PRINT_JOB_TABLE_INTERVAL`
  :jira:`2794`

*** 24.4.0 bugs

- Changed the numeric output of :tool:`htcondor job status` so that the rounding
  to megabytes, gigabytes, etc. matches the binary definitions the rest
  of the tools use.
  :jira:`2788`

*** 24.0.4 features

- For **arc** grid :subcom:`universe` jobs, the new submit command
  :subcom:`arc_data_staging` can be used to supply additional elements
  to the DataStaging block of the ARC ADL that HTCondor constructs.
  :jira:`2774`

*** 24.0.4 bugs

- Fixed a bug in the negotiator that caused it to crash when matching
  offline ads.
  :jira:`2819`

- Fixed a memory leak in the schedd that could be caused by ``SCHEDD_CRON``
  scripts that generate standard error output.
  :jira:`2817`

- Fixed a bug that cause the *condor_schedd* to crash with a segmentation
  fault if a :tool:`condor_off` ``-fast`` command was run while a schedd cron
  script was running.
  :jira:`2815`
