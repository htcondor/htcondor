Version 24.0.1
--------------

Release Notes:

.. HTCondor version 24.0.1 released on Month Date, 2024.

- HTCondor version 24.0.1 not yet released.

- :macro:`LVM_USE_THIN_PROVISIONING` now defaults to ``False``. This affects
  Execution Points using :macro:`STARTD_ENFORCE_DISK_LIMITS`.

New Features:

- None.

Bugs Fixed:

- On Windows the :tool:`htcondor` tool now uses the Python C API to try and
  launch the python interpretor.  This will fail with a message
  box about installing python if python 3.9 is not in the path.
  :jira:`2650`

- :meth:`htcondor2.Submit.from_dag` now recognizes ``DoRecov`` as a
  synonym for ``DoRecovery``.  This improves compatibility with
  version 1.
  :jira:`2613`

- :meth:`htcondor2.Submit.itemdata` now (correctly) returns an iterator over
  dictionaries if the :obj:`htcondor2.Submit` object specified variable
  names in its ``queue`` statement.
  :jira:`2613`

- When you specify item data using a :class:`dict`, HTCondor will now
  correctly reject values containing newlines.
  :jira:`2616`

- :tool:`htcondor annex` now reports a proper error if you request an annex
  from a GPU-enabled queue but don't specify how many GPUs per node you
  want (and the queue does not always allocate whole nodes).
  :jira:`2633`

- Fixed a bug where :tool:`condor_watch_q` would display ``None`` for jobs with
  no :ad-attr:`JobBatchName` instead of the expected :ad-attr:`ClusterId`.
  :jira:`2625`

- :meth:`htcondor2.Schedd.submit` now correctly raises a :obj:`TypeError`
  when passed a description that is not a :obj:`htcondor2.Submit` object.
  :jira:`2631`

- When submitting jobs to an SGE cluster via the grid universe, the
  blahp no longer saves the output of its wrapper script in the user's
  home directory (where the files would accumulate and never be
  cleaned up).
  :jira:`2630`

- Improved the error message when job submission as a disallowed user
  fails (i.e. submitting as the 'condor' or 'root' user).
  :jira:`2638`
