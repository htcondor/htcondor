Description
-----------

*htcondor* is a tool for managing HTCondor jobs, job sets, and resources.

For **jobs**, the **--resource** option allows you to run jobs on resources other than your
local HTCondor pool. By specifying either ``EC2`` or ``Slurm`` here, the tool
provisions resources for the time described by the **--runtime** option (in seconds) 
and sends your HTCondor job to run on them. It assumes you have already 
completed the necessary setup tasks, such as creating an account for Slurm
submissions or making your AWS access keys available for EC2 submissions.
