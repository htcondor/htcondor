Synopsis
--------

**condor_evicted_files** [COMMAND] <clusterID>.<procID>[ <clusterID.<procID>]*

Description
-----------

Print the directory or directories HTCondor is using to store files for the
specified job or jobs.  COMMAND may be one of *dir*, *list*, or *get*:

- *dir*:  Print the directory (for each job) in which the file(s) are stored.
- *list*:  List the contents of the directory (for each job).
- *get*:  Copy the contents of the directory to a subdirectory named after
  each job's ID.

General Remarks
---------------

The tool presently has a number of limitations:

- It must be run the same machine as the job's schedd.
- The schedd must NOT have ALTERNATE_JOB_SPOOL set
- You can't name the destination directory for the *get* command.
- The tool can't distinguish between an invalid job ID and a job for which
  HTCondor never held any files.
