Macintosh OS X
==============

:index:`Macintosh OS X<single: Macintosh OS X; platform-specific information>`

This section provides information specific to the Macintosh OS X port of
HTCondor. The Macintosh port of HTCondor is more accurately a port of
HTCondor to Darwin, the BSD layer of OS X.
It is not well-integrated into the Macintosh environment beyond that.

HTCondor on the Macintosh has a few shortcomings:

-  Users connected to the Macintosh via *ssh* are not noticed for
   console activity.
-  The memory size of threaded programs is reported incorrectly.
-  No Macintosh-based installer is provided.
-  The example start up scripts do not follow Macintosh conventions.
