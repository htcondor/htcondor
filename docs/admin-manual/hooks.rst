Hooks
==================================

:index:`Hooks`

A hook is an external program or script invoked by an HTCondor
daemon to change its behavior or implement some policy.
There are three kinds of Job hooks in HTCondor: Fetch work job hooks,
Prepare Job hooks, and Job Router hooks.

Job Hooks That Fetch Work
-------------------------

:index:`Job hooks`
:index:`job hooks that fetch work<single: job hooks that fetch work; Hooks>`

In the past, HTCondor has always sent work to the execute machines by
pushing jobs to the *condor_startd* daemon from the
*condor_schedd* daemon. Beginning with the
HTCondor version 7.1.0, the *condor_startd* daemon now has the ability
to pull work by fetching jobs via a system of plug-ins or hooks. Any
site can configure a set of hooks to fetch work, completely outside of
the usual HTCondor matchmaking system.

A projected use of the hook mechanism implements what might be termed a
glide-in factory, especially where the factory is behind a firewall.
Without using the hook mechanism to fetch work, a glide-in
*condor_startd* daemon behind a firewall depends on CCB to help it
listen and eventually receive work pushed from elsewhere. With the hook
mechanism, a glide-in *condor_startd* daemon behind a firewall uses the
hook to pull work. The hook needs only an outbound network connection to
complete its task, thereby being able to operate from behind the
firewall, without the intervention of CCB.

Periodically, each execution slot managed by a *condor_startd* will
invoke a hook to see if there is any work that can be fetched. Whenever
this hook returns a valid job, the *condor_startd* will evaluate the
current state of the slot and decide if it should start executing the
fetched work. If the slot is unclaimed and the ``Start`` expression
evaluates to ``True``, a new claim will be created for the fetched job.
If the slot is claimed, the *condor_startd* will evaluate the ``Rank``
expression relative to the fetched job, compare it to the value of
``Rank`` for the currently running job, and decide if the existing job
should be preempted due to the fetched job having a higher rank. If the
slot is unavailable for whatever reason, the *condor_startd* will
refuse the fetched job and ignore it. Either way, once the
*condor_startd* decides what it should do with the fetched job, it will
invoke another hook to reply to the attempt to fetch work, so that the
external system knows what happened to that work unit.

If the job is accepted, a claim is created for it and the slot moves
into the Claimed state. As soon as this happens, the *condor_startd*
will spawn a *condor_starter* to manage the execution of the job. At
this point, from the perspective of the *condor_startd*, this claim is
just like any other. The usual policy expressions are evaluated, and if
the job needs to be suspended or evicted, it will be. If a higher-ranked
job being managed by a *condor_schedd* is matched with the slot, that
job will preempt the fetched work.

The *condor_starter* itself can optionally invoke additional hooks to
help manage the execution of the specific job. There are hooks to
prepare or validate the execution environment for the job, periodically update
information about the job as it runs, notify when the job exits, and to
take special actions when the job is being evicted.

Assuming there are no interruptions, the job completes, and the
*condor_starter* exits, the *condor_startd* will invoke the hook to
fetch work again. If another job is available, the existing claim will
be reused and a new *condor_starter* is spawned. If the hook returns
that there is no more work to perform, the claim will be evicted, and
the slot will return to the Owner state.

To aid with the development and debugging of hooks, output sent to stderr
by the hooks will be preserved in daemon logs of either the *condor_starter* or
*condor_startd* as appropriate.

Work Fetching Hooks Invoked by HTCondor
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

:index:`Hooks invoked by HTCondor<single: Hooks invoked by HTCondor; Job hooks>`

There are a handful of hooks invoked by HTCondor related to fetching
work, some of which are called by the *condor_startd* and others by the
*condor_starter*. Each hook is described, including when it is invoked,
what task it is supposed to accomplish, what data is passed to the hook,
what output is expected, and, when relevant, the exit status expected.
:index:`Fetch work<single: Fetch work; Fetch Hooks>`

-  The hook defined by the configuration variable
   ``<Keyword>_HOOK_FETCH_WORK``
   :index:`<Keyword>_HOOK_FETCH_WORK` is invoked whenever the
   *condor_startd* wants to see if there is any work to fetch. There is
   a related configuration variable called ``FetchWorkDelay``
   :index:`FetchWorkDelay` which determines how long the
   *condor_startd* will wait between attempts to fetch work, which is
   described in detail in :ref:`admin-manual/hooks:job hooks that fetch work`.
   ``<Keyword>_HOOK_FETCH_WORK`` is the most important hook in the whole system,
   and is the only hook that must be defined for any of the other
   *condor_startd* hooks to operate.

    Command-line arguments passed to the hook
       None.
    Standard input given to the hook
       ClassAd of the slot that is looking for work.
    Expected standard output from the hook
       ClassAd of a job that can be run. If there is no work, the hook
       should return no output.
    User id that the hook runs as
       The ``<Keyword>_HOOK_FETCH_WORK``
       :index:`<Keyword>_HOOK_FETCH_WORK` hook runs with the same
       privileges as the *condor_startd*. When Condor was started as
       root, this is usually the condor user, or the user specified in
       the ``CONDOR_IDS`` :index:`CONDOR_IDS` configuration
       variable.
    Exit status of the hook
       Ignored.

   The job ClassAd returned by the hook needs to contain enough
   information for the *condor_starter* to eventually spawn the work.
   The required and optional attributes in this ClassAd are listed here:

    :index:`attributes<single: attributes; FetchWork>`
    :index:`Required attributes<single: Required attributes; Defining Applications>`

    Attributes for a FetchWork application are either required or optional. The
    following attributes are required:
    :index:`required attributes<single: required attributes; FetchWork>`

    ``Cmd``
        This attribute :index:`Cmd<single: Cmd; required attributes>`\ defines the
        full path to the executable program to be run as a FetchWork application.
        Since HTCondor does not currently provide any mechanism to transfer
        files on behalf of FetchWork applications, this path should be a valid
        path on the machine where the application will be run. It is a
        string attribute, and must therefore be enclosed in quotation marks
        ("). There is no default.

    ``Owner``
        If the *condor_startd* daemon is executing as root on
        :index:`Owner<single: Owner; required attributes>`\ the resource where a FetchWork
        application will run, the user must also define ``Owner`` to specify
        what user name the application will run as. On Windows, the
        *condor_startd* daemon always runs as an Administrator service,
        which is equivalent to running as root on Unix platforms.
        ``Owner`` must contain a valid user name on the given FetchWork resource.
        It is a string attribute, and must therefore be enclosed in
        quotation marks (").

    ``RequestCpus``
        Required when running on a *condor_startd*
        :index:`RequestCpus<single: RequestCpus; required attributes>`\ that uses
        partitionable slots. It specifies the number of CPU cores from the
        partitionable slot allocated for this job.

    ``RequestDisk``
        Required when running on a *condor_startd*
        :index:`RequestDisk<single: RequestDisk; required attributes>`\ that uses
        partitionable slots. It specifies the disk space, in Megabytes, from
        the partitionable slot allocated for this job.

    ``RequestMemory``
        Required when running on a *condor_startd*
        :index:`RequestMemory<single: RequestMemory; required attributes>`\ that uses
        partitionable slots. It specifies the memory, in Megabytes, from the
        partitionable slot allocated for this job.

    :index:`optional attributes<single: optional attributes; FetchWork>`
    :index:`Optional attributes<single: Optional attributes; Defining Applications>`

    The following list of attributes are optional:

    ``JobUniverse``
        This attribute defines what HTCondor job
        :index:`JobUniverse<single: JobUniverse; optional attributes>`\ universe to use
        for the given FetchWork application. The only tested universes are vanilla
        and java. This attribute must be an integer, with vanilla using the
        value 5, and java using the value 10.

    ``IWD``
        IWD is an acronym for Initial Working Directory.
        :index:`IWD<single: IWD; optional attributes>`\ It defines the full path
        to the directory where a given FetchWork application are to be run. Unless
        the application changes its current working directory, any relative
        path names used by the application will be relative to the IWD. If
        any other attributes that define file names (for example, ``In``,
        ``Out``, and so on) do not contain a full path, the ``IWD`` will
        automatically be pre-pended to those file names. It is a string
        attribute, and must therefore be enclosed in quotation marks ("). If
        the ``IWD`` is not specified, the temporary execution sandbox
        created by the *condor_starter* will be used as the initial working
        directory.

    ``In``
        This string defines the path to the file on the
        :index:`In<single: In; optional attributes>`\ FetchWork resource that should be
        used as standard input (``stdin``) for the FetchWork application. This
        file (and all parent directories) must be readable by whatever user
        the FetchWork application will run as. If not specified, the default is
        ``/dev/null``. It is a string attribute, and must therefore be
        enclosed in quotation marks (").

    ``Out``
        This string defines the path to the file on the
        :index:`Out<single: Out; optional attributes>`\ FetchWork resource that should
        be used as standard output (``stdout``) for the FetchWork application.
        This file must be writable (and all parent directories readable) by
        whatever user the FetchWork application will run as. If not specified, the
        default is ``/dev/null``. It is a string attribute, and must
        therefore be enclosed in quotation marks (").

    ``Err``
        This string defines the path to the file on the
        :index:`Err<single: Err; optional attributes>`\ FetchWork resource that should
        be used as standard error (``stderr``) for the FetchWork application. This
        file must be writable (and all parent directories readable) by
        whatever user the FetchWork application will run as. If not specified, the
        default is ``/dev/null``. It is a string attribute, and must
        therefore be enclosed in quotation marks (").

    ``Env``
        This string defines environment variables to
        :index:`Env<single: Env; optional attributes>`\ set for a given FetchWork
        application. Each environment variable has the form NAME=value.
        Multiple variables are delimited with a semicolon. An example:
        Env = "PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin;TERM=vt100" It is a string
        attribute, and must therefore be enclosed in quotation marks (").

    ``Args``
        This string attribute defines the list of
        :index:`Args<single: Args; optional attributes>`\ arguments to be supplied
        to the program on the command-line. The arguments are delimited
        (separated) by space characters. There is no default. If the
        ``JobUniverse`` corresponds to the Java universe, the first argument
        must be the name of the class containing ``main``. It is a string
        attribute, and must therefore be enclosed in quotation marks (").

    ``JarFiles``
        This string attribute is only used if
        :index:`JarFiles<single: JarFiles; optional attributes>`\ ``JobUniverse`` is 10
        (the Java universe). If a given FetchWork application is a Java program,
        specify the JAR files that the program requires with this attribute.
        There is no default. It is a string attribute, and must therefore be
        enclosed in quotation marks ("). Multiple file names may be
        delimited with either commas or white space characters, and
        therefore, file names can not contain spaces.

    ``KillSig``
        This attribute specifies what signal should be
        :index:`KillSig<single: KillSig; optional attributes>`\ sent whenever the
        HTCondor system needs to gracefully shutdown the FetchWork application. It
        can either be specified as a string containing the signal name (for
        example KillSig = "SIGQUIT"), or as an integer (KillSig = 3) The
        default is to use SIGTERM.

    ``StarterUserLog``
        This string specifies a file name for a
        :index:`StarterUserLog<single: StarterUserLog; optional attributes>`\ log file that
        the *condor_starter* daemon can write with entries for relevant
        events in the life of a given FetchWork application. It is similar to the
        job event log file specified for regular HTCondor jobs with the
        **Log** :index:`Log<single: Log; submit commands>` command in a submit
        description file. However, certain attributes that are placed in a
        job event log do not make sense in the FetchWork environment, and are
        therefore omitted. The default is not to write this log file. It is
        a string attribute, and must therefore be enclosed in quotation
        marks (").

    ``StarterUserLogUseXML``
        If the ``StarterUserLog``
        :index:`StarterUserLogUseXML<single: StarterUserLogUseXML; optional attributes>`\ attribute
        is defined, the default format is a human-readable format. However,
        HTCondor can write out this log in an XML representation, instead.
        To enable the XML format for this job event log, the
        ``StarterUserLogUseXML`` boolean is set to TRUE. The default if not
        specified is FALSE.

    If any attribute that specifies a path (``Cmd``, ``In``,
    ``Out``,\ ``Err``, ``StarterUserLog``) is not a full path name, HTCondor
    automatically prepends the value of ``IWD``.

   :index:`Reply to fetched work<single: Reply to fetched work; Fetch Hooks>`

-  The hook defined by the configuration variable
   ``<Keyword>_HOOK_REPLY_FETCH``
   :index:`<Keyword>_HOOK_REPLY_FETCH` is invoked whenever
   ``<Keyword>_HOOK_FETCH_WORK``
   :index:`<Keyword>_HOOK_FETCH_WORK` returns data and the
   *condor_startd* decides if it is going to accept the fetched job or
   not.

   The *condor_startd* will not wait for this hook to return before
   taking other actions, and it ignores all output. The hook is simply
   advisory, and it has no impact on the behavior of the
   *condor_startd*.

    Command-line arguments passed to the hook
       Either the string accept or reject.
    Standard input given to the hook
       A copy of the job ClassAd and the slot ClassAd (separated by the
       string ----- and a new line).
    Expected standard output from the hook
       None.
    User id that the hook runs as
       The ``<Keyword>_HOOK_REPLY_FETCH``
       :index:`<Keyword>_HOOK_REPLY_FETCH` hook runs with the same
       privileges as the *condor_startd*. When Condor was started as
       root, this is usually the condor user, or the user specified in
       the ``CONDOR_IDS`` :index:`CONDOR_IDS` configuration
       variable.
    Exit status of the hook
       Ignored.

   :index:`Evict a claim<single: Evict a claim; Fetch Hooks>`

-  The hook defined by the configuration variable
   ``<Keyword>_HOOK_EVICT_CLAIM``
   :index:`<Keyword>_HOOK_EVICT_CLAIM` is invoked whenever the
   *condor_startd* needs to evict a claim representing fetched work.

   The *condor_startd* will not wait for this hook to return before
   taking other actions, and ignores all output. The hook is simply
   advisory, and has no impact on the behavior of the *condor_startd*.

    Command-line arguments passed to the hook
       None.
    Standard input given to the hook
       A copy of the job ClassAd and the slot ClassAd (separated by the
       string ----- and a new line).
    Expected standard output from the hook
       None.
    User id that the hook runs as
       The ``<Keyword>_HOOK_EVICT_CLAIM``
       :index:`<Keyword>_HOOK_EVICT_CLAIM` hook runs with the same
       privileges as the *condor_startd*. When Condor was started as
       root, this is usually the condor user, or the user specified in
       the ``CONDOR_IDS`` :index:`CONDOR_IDS` configuration
       variable.
    Exit status of the hook
       Ignored.


Keywords to Define Job Fetch Hooks in the HTCondor Configuration files
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

:index:`keywords<single: keywords; Job hooks>`

Hooks are defined in the HTCondor configuration files by prefixing the
name of the hook with a keyword. This way, a given machine can have
multiple sets of hooks, each set identified by a specific keyword.

Each slot on the machine can define a separate keyword for the set of
hooks that should be used with ``SLOT<N>_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD``
:index:`SLOT<N>_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD`. For example, on slot 1, the
variable name will be called ``SLOT1_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD``. If the
slot-specific keyword is not defined, the *condor_startd* will use a
global keyword as defined by ``STARTD_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD``
:index:`STARTD_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD`.

Once a job is fetched via ``<Keyword>_HOOK_FETCH_WORK``
:index:`<Keyword>_HOOK_FETCH_WORK`, the *condor_startd* will
insert the keyword used to fetch that job into the job ClassAd as
``HookKeyword``. This way, the same keyword will be used to select the
hooks invoked by the *condor_starter* during the actual execution of
the job. 
The ``STARTER_DEFAULT_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD``
:index:`STARTER_DEFAULT_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD` config knob can define a default
hook keyword to use in the event that keyword defined by the job is invalid
or not specified.
Alternatively, the ``STARTER_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD``
:index:`STARTER_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD` can be defined to force the
*condor_starter* to always use a given keyword for its own hooks,
regardless of the value in the job ClassAd for the ``HookKeyword`` attribute.

For example, the following configuration defines two sets of hooks, and
on a machine with 4 slots, 3 of the slots use the global keyword for
running work from a database-driven system, and one of the slots uses a
custom keyword to handle work fetched from a web service.

.. code-block:: condor-config

      # Most slots fetch and run work from the database system.
      STARTD_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD = DATABASE

      # Slot4 fetches and runs work from a web service.
      SLOT4_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD = WEB

      # The database system needs to both provide work and know the reply
      # for each attempted claim.
      DATABASE_HOOK_DIR = /usr/local/condor/fetch/database
      DATABASE_HOOK_FETCH_WORK = $(DATABASE_HOOK_DIR)/fetch_work.php
      DATABASE_HOOK_REPLY_FETCH = $(DATABASE_HOOK_DIR)/reply_fetch.php

      # The web system only needs to fetch work.
      WEB_HOOK_DIR = /usr/local/condor/fetch/web
      WEB_HOOK_FETCH_WORK = $(WEB_HOOK_DIR)/fetch_work.php

The keywords ``"DATABASE"`` and ``"WEB"`` are completely arbitrary, so
each site is encouraged to use different (more specific) names as
appropriate for their own needs.

Defining the FetchWorkDelay Expression
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

:index:`FetchWorkDelay<single: FetchWorkDelay; Job hooks>`

There are two events that trigger the *condor_startd* to attempt to
fetch new work:

-  the *condor_startd* evaluates its own state
-  the *condor_starter* exits after completing some fetched work

Even if a given compute slot is already busy running other work, it is
possible that if it fetched new work, the *condor_startd* would prefer
this newly fetched work (via the ``Rank`` expression) over the work it
is currently running. However, the *condor_startd* frequently evaluates
its own state, especially when a slot is claimed. Therefore,
administrators can define a configuration variable which controls how
long the *condor_startd* will wait between attempts to fetch new work.
This variable is called ``FetchWorkDelay``
:index:`FetchWorkDelay`.

The ``FetchWorkDelay`` expression must evaluate to an integer, which
defines the number of seconds since the last fetch attempt completed
before the *condor_startd* will attempt to fetch more work. However, as
a ClassAd expression (evaluated in the context of the ClassAd of the
slot considering if it should fetch more work, and the ClassAd of the
currently running job, if any), the length of the delay can be based on
the current state the slot and even the currently running job.

For example, a common configuration would be to always wait 5 minutes
(300 seconds) between attempts to fetch work, unless the slot is
Claimed/Idle, in which case the *condor_startd* should fetch
immediately:

.. code-block:: condor-config

    FetchWorkDelay = ifThenElse(State == "Claimed" && Activity == "Idle", 0, 300)

If the *condor_startd* wants to fetch work, but the time since the last
attempted fetch is shorter than the current value of the delay
expression, the *condor_startd* will set a timer to fetch as soon as
the delay expires.

If this expression is not defined, the *condor_startd* will default to
a five minute (300 second) delay between all attempts to fetch work.

Job Hooks That Modify and Monitor Execution
-------------------------------------------

The Job ClassAd can be modified before execution, and the progress of the job can be modified
using hooks. These hooks are executed by the *condor_starter* and can be used with or without
using Fetch Work hooks.


   :index:`Prepare job before file transfer<single: Prepare job before file transfer; Fetch Hooks>`

-  The hook defined by the configuration variable
   ``<Keyword>_HOOK_PREPARE_JOB_BEFORE_TRANSFER``
   :index:`<Keyword>_HOOK_PREPARE_JOB_BEFORE_TRANSFER` is invoked by the
   *condor_starter* immediately before transferring the job's input files. This hook provides
   a chance to execute commands to set up or validate the job environment,
   and/or edit the job classad that is used by the *condor_starter*. 

   The *condor_starter* waits until this hook returns before attempting
   to transfer the input files for the job. If the hook returns a non-zero exit status, the
   *condor_starter* will assume an error was reached while attempting
   to set up the job environment and abort the job.

    Command-line arguments passed to the hook
       None.
    Standard input given to the hook
       A copy of the job ClassAd.
    Expected standard output from the hook
       A set of attributes to insert or update into the job ad. For
       example, changing the ``Cmd`` attribute to a quoted string
       changes the executable to be run.
       Two special attributes can also 
       be specified: ``HookStatusCode`` and ``HookStatusMessage``.
       ``HookStatusCode``, if specified and is not a negative number, will be used instead of the
       exit status of the hook unless the hook process exited due to a signal.  A status code of
       0 is success, and a positive integer indicates failure.  A status code between 1 and 299 (inclusive)
       will result in the job going on hold; 300 or greater will result in the job going back to the Idle state.
       The ``HookStatusMessage`` will be echoed into the job's event log file, and also be used as the
       Hold Reason string if the job is placed on hold.
    User id that the hook runs as
       The ``<Keyword>_HOOK_PREPARE_JOB``
       :index:`<Keyword>_HOOK_PREPARE_JOB` hook runs with the same
       privileges as the job itself. If slot users are defined, the hook
       runs as the slot user, just as the job does.
    Exit status of the hook
       0 for success preparing the job, any non-zero value on failure.

   :index:`Prepare job<single: Prepare job; Fetch Hooks>`

-  The hook defined by the configuration variable
   ``<Keyword>_HOOK_PREPARE_JOB``
   :index:`<Keyword>_HOOK_PREPARE_JOB` is invoked by the
   *condor_starter* before a job is going to be run but after the job's input files
   have been transferred. This hook provides
   a chance to execute commands to set up or validate the job environment,
   and/or edit the job classad that is used by the *condor_starter*. 

   The *condor_starter* waits until this hook returns before attempting
   to execute the job. If the hook returns a non-zero exit status, the
   *condor_starter* will assume an error was reached while attempting
   to set up the job environment and abort the job.

    Command-line arguments passed to the hook
       None.
    Standard input given to the hook
       A copy of the job ClassAd.
    Expected standard output from the hook
       A set of attributes to insert or update into the job ad. For
       example, changing the ``Cmd`` attribute to a quoted string
       changes the executable to be run.
       Two special attributes can also 
       be specified: ``HookStatusCode`` and ``HookStatusMessage``.
       ``HookStatusCode``, if specified and is not a negative number, will be used instead of the
       exit status of the hook unless the hook process exited due to a signal.  A status code of
       0 is success, and a positive integer indicates failure.  A status code between 1 and 299 (inclusive)
       will result in the job going on hold; 300 or greater will result in the job going back to the Idle state.
       The ``HookStatusMessage`` will be echoed into the job's event log file, and also be used as the
       Hold Reason string if the job is placed on hold.
    User id that the hook runs as
       The ``<Keyword>_HOOK_PREPARE_JOB``
       :index:`<Keyword>_HOOK_PREPARE_JOB` hook runs with the same
       privileges as the job itself. If slot users are defined, the hook
       runs as the slot user, just as the job does.
    Exit status of the hook
       0 for success preparing the job, any non-zero value on failure.

   :index:`Update job info<single: Update job info; Fetch Hooks>`

-  The hook defined by the configuration variable
   ``<Keyword>_HOOK_UPDATE_JOB_INFO``
   :index:`<Keyword>_HOOK_UPDATE_JOB_INFO` is invoked periodically
   during the life of the job to update information about the status of
   the job. When the job is first spawned, the *condor_starter* will
   invoke this hook after ``STARTER_INITIAL_UPDATE_INTERVAL``
   :index:`STARTER_INITIAL_UPDATE_INTERVAL` seconds (defaults to
   8). Thereafter, the *condor_starter* will invoke the hook every
   ``STARTER_UPDATE_INTERVAL`` :index:`STARTER_UPDATE_INTERVAL`
   seconds (defaults to 300, which is 5 minutes).

   The *condor_starter* will not wait for this hook to return before
   taking other actions, and ignores all output. The hook is simply
   advisory, and has no impact on the behavior of the *condor_starter*.

    Command-line arguments passed to the hook
       None.
    Standard input given to the hook
       A copy of the job ClassAd that has been augmented with additional
       attributes describing the current status and execution behavior
       of the job.

       The additional attributes included inside the job ClassAd are:

       ``JobState``
           The current state of the job. Can be either ``"Running"`` or
           ``"Suspended"``.
       ``JobPid``
           The process identifier for the initial job directly spawned
           by the *condor_starter*.
       ``NumPids``
           The number of processes that the job has currently spawned.
       ``JobStartDate``
           The epoch time when the job was first spawned by the
           *condor_starter*.
       ``RemoteSysCpu``
           The total number of seconds of system CPU time (the time
           spent at system calls) the job has used.
       ``RemoteUserCpu``
           The total number of seconds of user CPU time the job has
           used.
       ``ImageSize``
           The memory image size of the job in Kbytes.

    Expected standard output from the hook
       None.
    User id that the hook runs as
       The ``<Keyword>_HOOK_UPDATE_JOB_INFO``
       :index:`<Keyword>_HOOK_UPDATE_JOB_INFO` hook runs with the
       same privileges as the job itself.
    Exit status of the hook
       Ignored.

   :index:`Job exit<single: Job exit; Fetch Hooks>`

-  The hook defined by the configuration variable
   ``<Keyword>_HOOK_JOB_EXIT`` :index:`<Keyword>_HOOK_JOB_EXIT` is
   invoked by the *condor_starter* whenever a job exits, either on its
   own or when being evicted from an execution slot.

   The *condor_starter* will wait for this hook to return before taking
   any other actions. In the case of jobs that are being managed by a
   *condor_shadow*, this hook is invoked before the *condor_starter*
   does its own optional file transfer back to the submission machine,
   writes to the local job event log file, or notifies the
   *condor_shadow* that the job has exited.

    Command-line arguments passed to the hook
       A string describing how the job exited:

       -  exit The job exited or died with a signal on its own.
       -  remove The job was removed with *condor_rm* or as the result
          of user job policy expressions (for example,
          ``PeriodicRemove``).
       -  hold The job was held with *condor_hold* or the user job
          policy expressions (for example, ``PeriodicHold``).
       -  evict The job was evicted from the execution slot for any
          other reason (``PREEMPT`` :index:`PREEMPT` evaluated to
          TRUE in the *condor_startd*, *condor_vacate*, *condor_off*,
          etc).

    Standard input given to the hook
       A copy of the job ClassAd that has been augmented with additional
       attributes describing the execution behavior of the job and its
       final results.

       The job ClassAd passed to this hook contains all of the extra
       attributes described above for ``<Keyword>_HOOK_UPDATE_JOB_INFO``
       :index:`<Keyword>_HOOK_UPDATE_JOB_INFO`, and the following
       additional attributes that are only present once a job exits:

       ``ExitReason``
           A human-readable string describing why the job exited.
       ``ExitBySignal``
           A boolean indicating if the job exited due to being killed by
           a signal, or if it exited with an exit status.
       ``ExitSignal``
           If ``ExitBySignal`` is true, the signal number that killed
           the job.
       ``ExitCode``
           If ``ExitBySignal`` is false, the integer exit code of the
           job.
       ``JobDuration``
           The number of seconds that the job ran during this
           invocation.

    Expected standard output from the hook
       None.
    User id that the hook runs as
       The ``<Keyword>_HOOK_JOB_EXIT``
       :index:`<Keyword>_HOOK_JOB_EXIT` hook runs with the same
       privileges as the job itself.
    Exit status of the hook
       Ignored.


Example Hook: Specifying the Executable at Execution Time
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

:index:`Java example<single: Java example; Job hooks>`

The availability of multiple versions of an application leads to the
need to specify one of the versions. As an example, consider that the
java universe utilizes a single, fixed JVM. There may be multiple JVMs
available, and the HTCondor job may need to make the choice of JVM
version. The use of a job hook solves this problem. The job does not use
the java universe, and instead uses the vanilla universe in combination
with a prepare job hook to overwrite the ``Cmd`` attribute of the job
ClassAd. This attribute is the name of the executable the
*condor_starter* daemon will invoke, thereby selecting the specific JVM
installation.

In the configuration of the execute machine:

.. code-block:: condor-config

    JAVA5_HOOK_PREPARE_JOB = $(LIBEXEC)/java5_prepare_hook

With this configuration, a job that sets the ``HookKeyword`` attribute
with

.. code-block:: condor-submit

    +HookKeyword = "JAVA5"

in the submit description file causes the *condor_starter* will run the
hook specified by ``JAVA5_HOOK_PREPARE_JOB``
:index:`JAVA5_HOOK_PREPARE_JOB` before running this job. Note that
the double quote marks are required to correctly define the attribute.
Any output from this hook is an update to the job ClassAd. Therefore,
the hook that changes the executable may be

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/sh

    # Read and discard the job ClassAd
    cat > /dev/null
    echo 'Cmd = "/usr/java/java5/bin/java"'

If some machines in your pool have this hook and others do not, this
fact should be advertised. Add to the configuration of every execute
machine that has the hook:

.. code-block:: condor-config

    HasJava5PrepareHook = True
    STARTD_ATTRS = HasJava5PrepareHook $(STARTD_ATTRS)

The submit description file for this example job may be

.. code-block:: condor-submit

    universe = vanilla
    executable = /usr/bin/java
    arguments = Hello
    # match with a machine that has the hook
    requirements = HasJava5PrepareHook

    should_transfer_files = always
    when_to_transfer_output = on_exit
    transfer_input_files = Hello.class

    output = hello.out
    error  = hello.err
    log    = hello.log

    +HookKeyword="JAVA5"

    queue

Note that the
**requirements** :index:`requirements<single: requirements; submit commands>` command
ensures that this job matches with a machine that has
``JAVA5_HOOK_PREPARE_JOB`` defined.

Hooks for the Job Router
------------------------

:index:`Job Router hooks<single: Job Router hooks; Hooks>`

Job Router Hooks allow for an alternate transformation and/or monitoring
than the *condor_job_router* daemon implements. Routing is still
managed by the *condor_job_router* daemon, but if the Job Router Hooks
are specified, then these hooks will be used to transform and monitor
the job instead.

Job Router Hooks are similar in concept to Fetch Work Hooks, but they
are limited in their scope. A hook is an external program or script
invoked by the *condor_job_router* daemon at various points during the
life cycle of a routed job.

The following sections describe how and when these hooks are used, what
hooks are invoked at various stages of the job's life, and how to
configure HTCondor to use these Hooks.

Hooks Invoked for Job Routing
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

:index:`Job Router`

The Job Router Hooks allow for replacement of the transformation engine
used by HTCondor for routing a job. Since the external transformation
engine is not controlled by HTCondor, additional hooks provide a means
to update the job's status in HTCondor, and to clean up upon exit or
failure cases. This allows one job to be transformed to just about any
other type of job that HTCondor supports, as well as to use execution
nodes not normally available to HTCondor.

It is important to note that if the Job Router Hooks are utilized, then
HTCondor will not ignore or work around a failure in any hook execution.
If a hook is configured, then HTCondor assumes its invocation is
required and will not continue by falling back to a part of its internal
engine. For example, if there is a problem transforming the job using
the hooks, HTCondor will not fall back on its transformation
accomplished without the hook to process the job.

There are 2 ways in which the Job Router Hooks may be enabled. A job's
submit description file may cause the hooks to be invoked with

.. code-block:: condor-submit

    +HookKeyword = "HOOKNAME"

Adding this attribute to the job's ClassAd causes the
*condor_job_router* daemon on the access point to invoke hooks
prefixed with the defined keyword. ``HOOKNAME`` is a string chosen as an
example; any string may be used.

The job's ClassAd attribute definition of ``HookKeyword`` takes
precedence, but if not present, hooks may be enabled by defining on the
access point the configuration variable

.. code-block:: condor-config

     JOB_ROUTER_HOOK_KEYWORD = HOOKNAME

Like the example attribute above, ``HOOKNAME`` represents a chosen name
for the hook, replaced as desired or appropriate.

There are 4 hooks that the Job Router can be configured to use. Each
hook will be described below along with data passed to the hook and
expected output. All hooks must exit successfully.
:index:`Translate Job<single: Translate Job; Job Router Hooks>`

-  The hook defined by the configuration variable
   ``<Keyword>_HOOK_TRANSLATE_JOB``
   :index:`<Keyword>_HOOK_TRANSLATE_JOB` is invoked when the Job
   Router has determined that a job meets the definition for a route.
   This hook is responsible for doing the transformation of the job and
   configuring any resources that are external to HTCondor if
   applicable.

    Command-line arguments passed to the hook
       None.
    Standard input given to the hook
       The first line will be the information on route that the job matched
       including the route name. This information will be formatted as a classad.
       If the route has a  ``TargetUniverse`` or ``GridResource`` they will be
       included in the classad. The route information classad will be followed
       by a separator line of dashes like ``------`` followed by a newline.
       The remainder of the input will be the job ClassAd.
    Expected standard output from the hook
       The transformed job.
    Exit status of the hook
       0 for success, any non-zero value on failure.

   :index:`Update Job Info<single: Update Job Info; Job Router Hooks>`

-  The hook defined by the configuration variable
   ``<Keyword>_HOOK_UPDATE_JOB_INFO``
   :index:`<Keyword>_HOOK_UPDATE_JOB_INFO` is invoked to provide
   status on the specified routed job when the Job Router polls the
   status of routed jobs at intervals set by
   ``JOB_ROUTER_POLLING_PERIOD``
   :index:`JOB_ROUTER_POLLING_PERIOD`.

    Command-line arguments passed to the hook
       None.
    Standard input given to the hook
       The routed job ClassAd that is to be updated.
    Expected standard output from the hook
       The job attributes to be updated in the routed job, or nothing,
       if there was no update. To prevent clashing with HTCondor's
       management of job attributes, only attributes that are not
       managed by HTCondor should be output from this hook.
    Exit status of the hook
       0 for success, any non-zero value on failure.

   :index:`Job Finalize<single: Job Finalize; Job Router Hooks>`

-  The hook defined by the configuration variable
   ``<Keyword>_HOOK_JOB_FINALIZE``
   :index:`<Keyword>_HOOK_JOB_FINALIZE` is invoked when the Job
   Router has found that the job has completed. Any output from the hook
   is treated as an update to the source job.

    Command-line arguments passed to the hook
       None.
    Standard input given to the hook
       The source job ClassAd, followed by the routed copy Classad that
       completed, separated by the string "------" and a new line.
    Expected standard output from the hook
       An updated source job ClassAd, or nothing if there was no update.
    Exit status of the hook
       0 for success, any non-zero value on failure.

   :index:`Job Cleanup<single: Job Cleanup; Job Router Hooks>`

-  The hook defined by the configuration variable
   ``<Keyword>_HOOK_JOB_CLEANUP``
   :index:`<Keyword>_HOOK_JOB_CLEANUP` is invoked when the Job
   Router finishes managing the job. This hook will be invoked
   regardless of whether the job completes successfully or not, and must
   exit successfully.

    Command-line arguments passed to the hook
       None.
    Standard input given to the hook
       The job ClassAd that the Job Router is done managing.
    Expected standard output from the hook
       None.
    Exit status of the hook
       0 for success, any non-zero value on failure.
