In this module, we'll learn the basics of querying the collector for information and displaying results.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are several other daemons - particularly, the _Startd_ and the _Negotiator_ - that the Python bindings can interact with.  We'll cover those in the advanced modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are running these tutorials in the provided Docker container or on Binder, a local HTCondor pool has been started in the background for you to interact with.\n",

    " - Because we didn't provide the collector with a constructor, we used the default collector in the container's configuration file.\n",
    "   If we wanted to instead query a non-default collector, we could have done `htcondor.Collector(\"collector.example.com\")`.\n",
    " - We used the `DaemonTypes` enumeration to pick the kind of daemon to return.\n",
    " - If there were multiple schedds in the pool, the `locate` query would have failed.\n",
    "   In such a case, we need to provide an explicit name to the method.  E.g., `coll.locate(htcondor.DaemonTypes.Schedd, \"schedd.example.com\")`.\n",
    " - The `MyAddress` field in the ad is the actual address information.\n",
    "   You may be surprised that this is not simply a `hostname:port`; \n",
    "   to help manage addressing in the today's complicated Internet (full of NATs, private networks, and firewalls), a more flexible structure was needed.\n",
    "   HTCondor developers sometimes refer to this as the _sinful string_; here, _sinful_ is a play on a Unix data structure, not a moral judgement.\n",
    "   \n",
    "The `locate` method often returns only enough data to contact a remote daemon.  Typically, a ClassAd records significantly more attributes.  For example, if we wanted to query for a few specific attributes, we would use the `query` method instead:"
