When using file transfer concurrency limits, the following additional
I/O usage statistics are published. These includes the sum and rate of
bytes transferred as well as time spent reading and writing to files and
to the network. These statistics are reported for the sum of all users
and may also be reported individually for recently active users by
increasing the verbosity level ``STATISTICS_TO_PUBLISH = TRANSFER:2``.
Each of the per-user statistics is prefixed by a user name in the form
``Owner_<username>_FileTransferUploadBytes``. In this case, the
attribute represents activity by the specified user. The published user
name is actually the file transfer queue name, as defined by configuration
variable :macro:`TRANSFER_QUEUE_USER_EXPR`. This expression defaults to
``Owner_`` followed by the name of the job owner. The attributes that
are rates have a suffix that specifies the time span of the exponential
moving average. By default the time spans that are published are 1m, 5m,
1h, and 1d. This can be changed by configuring configuration variable
:macro:`TRANSFER_IO_REPORT_TIMESPANS`. These attributes are only reported
once a full time span has accumulated.

:classad-attribute-def:`FileTransferDiskThrottleExcess_<timespan>`
    The exponential moving average of the disk load that exceeds the
    upper limit set for the disk load throttle. Periods of time in which
    there is no excess and no waiting transfers do not contribute to the
    average. This attribute is published only if configuration variable
    :macro:`FILE_TRANSFER_DISK_LOAD_THROTTLE` is defined.

:classad-attribute-def:`FileTransferDiskThrottleHigh`
    The desired upper limit for the disk load from file transfers, as
    configured by :macro:`FILE_TRANSFER_DISK_LOAD_THROTTLE`
    This attribute is published only if configuration variable
    :macro:`FILE_TRANSFER_DISK_LOAD_THROTTLE` is defined.

:classad-attribute-def:`FileTransferDiskThrottleLevel`
    The current concurrency limit set by the disk load throttle. The
    limit is applied to the sum of uploads and downloads. This attribute
    is published only if configuration variable
    :macro:`FILE_TRANSFER_DISK_LOAD_THROTTLE` is defined.

:classad-attribute-def:`FileTransferDiskThrottleLow`
    The lower limit for the disk load from file transfers, as configured
    by :macro:`FILE_TRANSFER_DISK_LOAD_THROTTLE` This attribute is published
    only if configuration variable :macro:`FILE_TRANSFER_DISK_LOAD_THROTTLE`
    is defined.

:classad-attribute-def:`FileTransferDiskThrottleShortfall_<timespan>`
    The exponential moving average of the disk load that falls below the
    upper limit set for the disk load throttle. Periods of time in which
    there is no excess and no waiting transfers do not contribute to the
    average. This attribute is published only if configuration variable
    :macro:`FILE_TRANSFER_DISK_LOAD_THROTTLE` is defined.

:index:`TRANSFER_QUEUE_USER_EXPR`

:classad-attribute-def:`FileTransferDownloadBytes`
    Total number of bytes downloaded as output from jobs since this
    *condor_schedd* was started. If :macro:`STATISTICS_TO_PUBLISH`
    contains ``TRANSFER:2``, for each active user, this attribute
    is also published prefixed by the user name, with the name
    ``Owner_<username>_FileTransferDownloadBytes``. The published user
    name is actually the file transfer queue name, as defined by
    configuration variable :macro:`TRANSFER_QUEUE_USER_EXPR`

:classad-attribute-def:`FileTransferDownloadBytesPerSecond_<timespan>`
    Exponential moving average over the specified time span of the rate
    at which bytes have been downloaded as output from jobs. The time
    spans that are published are configured by :macro:`TRANSFER_IO_REPORT_TIMESPANS`
    , which defaults to 1m, 5m, 1h, and 1d. When less than one full
    time span has accumulated, the attribute is not published. If
    :macro:`STATISTICS_TO_PUBLISH` contains ``TRANSFER:2``, for
    each active user, this attribute is also published prefixed by the
    user name, with the name
    ``Owner_<username>_FileTransferDownloadBytesPerSecond_<timespan>``.
    The published user name is actually the file transfer queue name, as
    defined by configuration variable :macro:`TRANSFER_QUEUE_USER_EXPR`

:classad-attribute-def:`FileTransferFileReadLoad_<timespan>`
    Exponential moving average over the specified time span of the rate
    at which submit-side file transfer processes have spent time reading
    from files to be transferred as input to jobs. One file transfer
    process spending nearly all of its time reading files will generate
    a load close to 1.0. The time spans that are published are configured
    by :macro:`TRANSFER_IO_REPORT_TIMESPANS`, which defaults to 1m,
    5m, 1h, and 1d. When less than one full time span has accumulated,
    the attribute is not published. If :macro:`STATISTICS_TO_PUBLISH`
    contains ``TRANSFER:2``, for each active user, this attribute is
    also published prefixed by the user name, with the name
    ``Owner_<username>_FileTransferFileReadLoad_<timespan>``. The
    published user name is actually the file transfer queue name, as
    defined by configuration variable :macro:`TRANSFER_QUEUE_USER_EXPR`

:classad-attribute-def:`FileTransferFileReadSeconds`
    Total number of submit-side transfer process seconds spent reading
    from files to be transferred as input to jobs since this
    *condor_schedd* was started. If :macro:`STATISTICS_TO_PUBLISH`
    contains ``TRANSFER:2``, for each active user, this attribute is also published prefixed by the
    user name, with the name
    ``Owner_<username>_FileTransferFileReadSeconds``. The published user
    name is actually the file transfer queue name, as defined by
    configuration variable :macro:`TRANSFER_QUEUE_USER_EXPR`

:classad-attribute-def:`FileTransferFileWriteLoad_<timespan>`
    Exponential moving average over the specified time span of the rate
    at which submit-side file transfer processes have spent time writing
    to files transferred as output from jobs. One file transfer process
    spending nearly all of its time writing to files will generate a
    load close to 1.0. The time spans that are published are configured
    by :macro:`TRANSFER_IO_REPORT_TIMESPANS`, which defaults to 1m,
    5m, 1h, and 1d. When less than one full time span has accumulated,
    the attribute is not published. If :macro:`STATISTICS_TO_PUBLISH`
    contains ``TRANSFER:2``, for each active user, this attribute is
    also published prefixed by the user name, with the name
    ``Owner_<username>_FileTransferFileWriteLoad_<timespan>``. The
    published user name is actually the file transfer queue name, as
    defined by configuration variable :macro:`TRANSFER_QUEUE_USER_EXPR`

:classad-attribute-def:`FileTransferFileWriteSeconds`
    Total number of submit-side transfer process seconds spent writing
    to files transferred as output from jobs since this *condor_schedd*
    was started. If :macro:`STATISTICS_TO_PUBLISH` contains ``TRANSFER:2``,
    for each active user, this attribute is also published prefixed by
    the user name, with the name
    ``Owner_<username>_FileTransferFileWriteSeconds``. The published
    user name is actually the file transfer queue name, as defined by
    configuration variable :macro:`TRANSFER_QUEUE_USER_EXPR`

:classad-attribute-def:`FileTransferNetReadLoad_<timespan>`
    Exponential moving average over the specified time span of the rate
    at which submit-side file transfer processes have spent time reading
    from the network when transferring output from jobs. One file
    transfer process spending nearly all of its time reading from the
    network will generate a load close to 1.0. The reason a file
    transfer process may spend a long time writing to the network could
    be a network bottleneck on the path between the submit and execute
    machine. It could also be caused by slow reads from the disk on the
    execute side. The time spans that are published are configured by
    :macro:`TRANSFER_IO_REPORT_TIMESPANS`, which defaults to 1m,
    5m, 1h, and 1d. When less than one full time span has accumulated,
    the attribute is not published. If :macro:`STATISTICS_TO_PUBLISH`
    contains ``TRANSFER:2``, for each active user, this attribute is
    also published prefixed by the user name, with the name
    ``Owner_<username>_FileTransferNetReadLoad_<timespan>``. The

    Exponential moving average over the specified time span of the rate
    at which submit-side file transfer processes have spent time writing
    to the network when transferring input to jobs. One file transfer
    process spending nearly all of its time writing to the network will
    generate a load close to 1.0. The reason a file transfer process may
    spend a long time writing to the network could be a network
