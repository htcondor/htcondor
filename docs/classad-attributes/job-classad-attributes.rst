Job ClassAd Attributes
======================

Both active HTCondor jobs (those in a `condor_schedd`) and historical jobs
(those in the history file), are described by classads.  Active jobs can be
queried and displayed with the `condor_q` command, and historical jobs
are queried with the `condor_history` command, as in the examples below.
Note that not all job attributes are described here, some are for internal
HTCondor use, and are subject to change.  Also, not all jobs contain
all attributes.

.. code-block:: console

    $ condor_history -l username
    $ condor_q -l

    The number of seconds of wall clock time that the job has been
    allocated a machine, excluding the time spent on run attempts that
    were evicted without a checkpoint. Like ``RemoteWallClockTime``,
    this includes time the job spent in a suspended state, so the total

:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; ConcurrencyLimits>`

``ConcurrencyLimits``
    A string list, delimited by commas and space characters. The items
    in the list identify named resources that the job requires. The
    value can be a ClassAd expression which, when evaluated in the

    in a string list.

:index:`CumulativeSlotTime<single: CumulativeSlotTime; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; CumulativeSlotTime>`

``CumulativeSlotTime``
    This attribute is identical to ``RemoteWallClockTime`` except that
    the time is multiplied by the ``SlotWeight`` of the machine(s) that
    ran the job. This relies on ``SlotWeight`` being listed in
    ``SYSTEM_JOB_MACHINE_ATTRS``

:index:`SYSTEM_JOB_MACHINE_ATTRS`
:index:`CumulativeSuspensionTime<single: CumulativeSuspensionTime; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; CumulativeSuspensionTime>`

``DAGManJobId``
    For a DAGMan node job only, the ``ClusterId`` job ClassAd attribute
    of the *condor_dagman* job which is the parent of this node job.
    For nested DAGs, this attribute holds only the ``ClusterId`` of the
    job's immediate parent.

:index:`DAGParentNodeNames<single: DAGParentNodeNames; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; DAGParentNodeNames>`

``DAGParentNodeNames``
    For a DAGMan node job only, a comma separated list of each *JobName*
    which is a parent node of this job's node. This attribute is passed
    through to the job via the *condor_submit* command line, if it does
    not exceed the line length defined with ``_POSIX_ARG_MAX``. For
    example, if a node job has two parents with *JobName* s B and C,
    the *condor_submit* command line will contain

    .. code-block:: text

          -append +DAGParentNodeNames="B,C"


:index:`DAGManNodesLog<single: DAGManNodesLog; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; DAGManNodesLog>`


``DAGManNodesLog``
    For a DAGMan node job only, gives the path to an event log used
    exclusively by DAGMan to monitor the state of the DAG's jobs. Events
    are written to this log file in addition to any log file specified
    in the job's submit description file.

:index:`DAGManNodesMask<single: DAGManNodesMask; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; DAGManNodesMask>`

``DAGManNodesMask``
    For a DAGMan node job only, a comma-separated list of the event
    codes that should be written to the log specified by
    ``DAGManNodesLog``, known as the auxiliary log. All events not
    specified in the ``DAGManNodesMask`` string are not written to the
    auxiliary event log. The value of this attribute is determined by
    DAGMan, and it is passed to the job via the *condor_submit* command
    line. By default, the following events are written to the auxiliary
    job log:

    -  ``Submit``, event code is 0
    -  ``Execute``, event code is 1
    -  ``Executable error``, event code is 2
    -  ``Job evicted``, event code is 4
    -  ``Job terminated``, event code is 5
    -  ``Shadow exception``, event code is 7
    -  ``Job aborted``, event code is 9
    -  ``Job suspended``, event code is 10
    -  ``Job unsuspended``, event code is 11
    -  ``Job held``, event code is 12
    -  ``Job released``, event code is 13
    -  ``Post script terminated``, event code is 16
    -  ``Grid submit``, event code is 27

    If ``DAGManNodesLog`` is not defined, it has no effect. The value of
    ``DAGManNodesMask`` does not affect events recorded in the job event
    log file referred to by ``UserLog``.

:index:`DelegateJobGSICredentialsLifetime<single: DelegateJobGSICredentialsLifetime; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; DelegateJobGSICredentialsLifetime>`


``DelegateJobGSICredentialsLifetime``
    An integer that specifies the maximum number of seconds for which
    delegated proxies should be valid. The default behavior is
    determined by the configuration setting
    ``DELEGATE_JOB_GSI_CREDENTIALS_LIFETIME``

:index:`DELEGATE_JOB_GSI_CREDENTIALS_LIFETIME`
    which defaults
    to one day. A value of 0 indicates that the delegated proxy should
    be valid for as long as allowed by the credential used to create the
    proxy. This setting currently only applies to proxies delegated for
    non-grid jobs and HTCondor-C jobs.
    This setting has no effect if the configuration setting
    ``DELEGATE_JOB_GSI_CREDENTIALS``
    :index:`DELEGATE_JOB_GSI_CREDENTIALS` is false, because in
    that case the job proxy is copied rather than delegated.

:index:`DiskUsage<single: DiskUsage; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; DiskUsage>`

``DiskUsage``
    Amount of disk space (KiB) in the HTCondor execute directory on the
    execute machine that this job has used. An initial value may be set
    at the job's request, placing into the job's submit description file
    a setting such as

    .. code-block:: condor-submit

          # 1 megabyte initial value
          +DiskUsage = 1024

    **vm** universe jobs will default to an initial value of the disk
    image size. If not initialized by the job, non-**vm** universe jobs
    will default to an initial value of the sum of the job's executable
    and all input files.

``HoldReasonSubCode``
    An integer value that represents further information to go along
    with the ``HoldReasonCode``, for some values of ``HoldReasonCode``.
    See ``HoldReasonCode`` for a table of possible values.

:index:`HookKeyword<single: HookKeyword; ClassAd machine attribute>`

``HookKeyword``
    A string that uniquely identifies a set of job hooks, and added to
    the ClassAd once a job is fetched.

:index:`ImageSize<single: ImageSize; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; ImageSize>`

``ImageSize``
    Maximum observed memory image size (i.e. virtual memory) of the job
    in KiB. The initial value is equal to the size of the executable for
    non-vm universe jobs, and 0 for vm universe jobs. When the job
    writes a checkpoint, the ``ImageSize`` attribute is set to the size
    of the checkpoint file (since the checkpoint file contains the job's
    memory image). A vanilla universe job's ``ImageSize`` is recomputed
    internally every 15 seconds. How quickly this updated information
    becomes visible to *condor_q* is controlled by
    ``SHADOW_QUEUE_UPDATE_INTERVAL`` and ``STARTER_UPDATE_INTERVAL``.

    Under Linux, ``ProportionalSetSize`` is a better indicator of memory
    usage for jobs with significant sharing of memory between processes,
    because ``ImageSize`` is simply the sum of virtual memory sizes
    across all of the processes in the job, which may count the same
    memory pages more than once.

``JobAdInformationAttrs``
    A comma-separated list of attribute names. The named attributes and
    their values are written in the job event log whenever any event is
    being written to the log. This is the same as the configuration
    setting ``EVENT_LOG_INFORMATION_ATTRS`` (see
    :ref:`admin-manual/configuration-macros:daemon logging configuration file
    entries`) but it applies to the job event log instead of the system event log.

``JobDescription``
    A string that may be defined for a job by setting
    **description** :index:`description<single: description; submit commands>` in the
    submit description file. When set, tools which display the
    executable such as *condor_q* will instead use this string. For
    interactive jobs that do not have a submit description file, this
    string will default to ``"Interactive job"``.

:index:`JobDisconnectedDate<single: JobDisconnectedDate; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; JobDisconnectedDate>`

:index:`JobRunCount<single: JobRunCount; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; JobRunCount>`

``JobRunCount``
    This attribute is retained for backwards compatibility. It may go
    away in the future. It is equivalent to ``NumShadowStarts`` for all
    universes except **scheduler**. For the **scheduler** universe, this
    attribute is equivalent to ``NumJobStarts``.

:index:`JobStartDate<single: JobStartDate; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; JobStartDate>`

``JobStartDate``
    Time at which the job first began running. Measured in the number of
    seconds since the epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970). Due to a long
    standing bug in the 8.6 series and earlier, the job classad that is
    internal to the *condor_startd* and *condor_starter* sets this to
    the time that the job most recently began executing. This bug is
    scheduled to be fixed in the 8.7 series.

:index:`KeepClaimIdle<single: KeepClaimIdle; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; KeepClaimIdle>`


``KeepClaimIdle``
    An integer value that represents the number of seconds that the
    *condor_schedd* will continue to keep a claim, in the Claimed Idle
    state, after the job with this attribute defined completes, and
    there are no other jobs ready to run from this user. This attribute
    may improve the performance of linear DAGs, in the case when a
    dependent job can not be scheduled until its parent has completed.
    Extending the claim on the machine may permit the dependent job to
    be scheduled with less delay than with waiting for the
    *condor_negotiator* to match with a new machine.

:index:`KillSig<single: KillSig; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; KillSig>`

``KillSig``

    machines. :index:`KillSigTimeout<single: KillSigTimeout; ClassAd job attribute>`

:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; KillSigTimeout>`

``KillSigTimeout``
    This attribute is replaced by the functionality in
    ``JobMaxVacateTime`` as of HTCondor version 7.7.3. The number of
    seconds that the job requests the
    *condor_starter* wait after sending the signal defined as
    ``KillSig`` and before forcibly removing the job. The actual amount
    of time will be the minimum of this value and the execute machine's
    configuration variable ``KILLING_TIMEOUT``

:index:`KILLING_TIMEOUT`
:index:`LastMatchTime<single: LastMatchTime; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; LastMatchTime>`

    If, at any point in the past, this job failed to match with a
    resource ad, this attribute will contain a string with a
    human-readable message about why the match failed.

:index:`LastRejMatchTime<single: LastRejMatchTime; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; LastRejMatchTime>`

``LastRejMatchTime``
    An integer containing the epoch time when HTCondor-G last tried to
    find a match for the job, but failed to do so.

:index:`LastRemotePool<single: LastRemotePool; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; LastRemotePool>`

``LastRemotePool``
    The name of the *condor_collector* of the pool in which a job ran
    via flocking in the most recent run attempt. This attribute is not
    defined if the job did not run via flocking.

:index:`LastSuspensionTime<single: LastSuspensionTime; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; LastSuspensionTime>`

``LastSuspensionTime``
    Time at which the job last performed a successful suspension.
    Measured in the number of seconds since the epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan
    1, 1970). :index:`LastVacateTime<single: LastVacateTime; ClassAd job attribute>`

:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; LastVacateTime>`

``LastVacateTime``
    Time at which the job was last evicted from a remote workstation.
    Measured in the number of seconds since the epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan
    1, 1970). :index:`LeaveJobInQueue<single: LeaveJobInQueue; ClassAd job attribute>`

:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; LeaveJobInQueue>`

``LeaveJobInQueue``
    A boolean expression that defaults to ``False``, causing the job to
    be removed from the queue upon completion. An exception is if the
    job is submitted using ``condor_submit -spool``. For this case, the
    default expression causes the job to be kept in the queue for 10
    days after completion.

:index:`LocalSysCpu<single: LocalSysCpu; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; LocalSysCpu>`

``MachineAttr<X><N>``
    Machine attribute of name ``<X>`` that is placed into this job
    ClassAd, as specified by the configuration variable
    ``SYSTEM_JOB_MACHINE_ATTRS``. With the potential for multiple run
    attempts, ``<N>`` represents an integer value providing historical
    values of this machine attribute for multiple runs. The most recent
    run will have a value of ``<N>`` equal to ``0``. The next most
    recent run will have a value of ``<N>`` equal to ``1``.

:index:`MaxHosts<single: MaxHosts; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; MaxHosts>`

``MaxHosts``
    The maximum number of hosts that this job would like to claim. As
    long as ``CurrentHosts`` is the same as ``MaxHosts``, no more hosts
    are negotiated for.

:index:`MaxJobRetirementTime<single: MaxJobRetirementTime; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; MaxJobRetirementTime>`

``MaxJobRetirementTime``
    Maximum time in seconds to let this job run uninterrupted before
    kicking it off when it is being preempted. This can only decrease
    the amount of time from what the corresponding startd expression
    allows. :index:`MaxTransferInputMB<single: MaxTransferInputMB; ClassAd job attribute>`

:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; MaxTransferInputMB>`

``MaxTransferInputMB``
    This integer expression specifies the maximum allowed total size in
    Mbytes of the input files that are transferred for a job. This
    expression does not apply to grid universe or
    files transferred via file transfer plug-ins. The expression may
    refer to attributes of the job. The special value -1 indicates no
    limit. If not set, the system setting ``MAX_TRANSFER_INPUT_MB``

:index:`MAX_TRANSFER_INPUT_MB`
    is used. If the observed size
    of all input files at submit time is larger than the limit, the job
    will be immediately placed on hold with a ``HoldReasonCode`` value
    of 32. If the job passes this initial test, but the size of the
    input files increases or the limit decreases so that the limit is
    violated, the job will be placed on hold at the time when the file
    transfer is attempted.

:index:`MaxTransferOutputMB<single: MaxTransferOutputMB; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; MaxTransferOutputMB>`

``MaxTransferOutputMB``
    This integer expression specifies the maximum allowed total size in
    Mbytes of the output files that are transferred for a job. This
    expression does not apply to grid universe or
    files transferred via file transfer plug-ins. The expression may
    refer to attributes of the job. The special value -1 indicates no
    limit. If not set, the system setting ``MAX_TRANSFER_OUTPUT_MB``

:index:`MAX_TRANSFER_OUTPUT_MB`
    is used. If the total size of
    the job's output files to be transferred is larger than the limit,
    the job will be placed on hold with a ``HoldReasonCode`` value of
    33. The output will be transferred up to the point when the limit is
    hit, so some files may be fully transferred, some partially, and
    some not at all.

:index:`MemoryUsage<single: MemoryUsage; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; MemoryUsage>`

``MemoryUsage``
    An integer expression in units of Mbytes that represents the peak
    memory usage for the job. Its purpose is to be compared with the
    value defined by a job with the
    **request_memory** :index:`request_memory<single: request_memory; submit commands>`
    submit command, for purposes of policy evaluation.

:index:`MinHosts<single: MinHosts; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; MinHosts>`

``MinHosts``
    The minimum number of hosts that must be in the claimed state for
    this job, before the job may enter the running state.

:index:`NextJobStartDelay<single: NextJobStartDelay; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; NextJobStartDelay>`

``NextJobStartDelay``
    An integer number of seconds delay time after this job starts until
    the next job is started. The value is limited by the configuration
    variable ``MAX_NEXT_JOB_START_DELAY``

:index:`MAX_NEXT_JOB_START_DELAY`
:index:`NiceUser<single: NiceUser; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; NiceUser>`

``NiceUser``
    Boolean value which when ``True`` indicates that this job is a nice
    job, raising its user priority value, thus causing it to run on a
    machine only when no other HTCondor jobs want the machine.

:index:`Nonessential<single: Nonessential; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; Nonessential>`

``Nonessential``
    A boolean value only relevant to grid universe jobs, which when
    ``True`` tells HTCondor to simply abort (remove) any problematic
    job, instead of putting the job on hold. It is the equivalent of
    doing *condor_rm* followed by *condor_rm* **-forcex** any time the
    job would have otherwise gone on hold. If not explicitly set to
    ``True``, the default value will be ``False``.

:index:`NTDomain<single: NTDomain; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; NTDomain>`

``NTDomain``
    A string that identifies the NT domain under which a job's owner
    authenticates on a platform running Windows.

:index:`NumCkpts<single: NumCkpts; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; NumCkpts>`

``NumCkpts``

    lifetime.
    
:index:`NumHolds<single: NumHolds; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; NumHolds>`

``NumHolds``
    An integer value that will increment every time a job is placed on hold.
    It may be undefined until the job has been held at least once.

:index:`NumHoldsByReason<single: NumHoldsByReason; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; NumHoldsByReason>`

``NumHoldsByReason``
    The value of this attribute is a (nested) classad containing a count of how many times a job has been placed 
    on  hold grouped by the reason the job went on hold.  It may be undefined until the job has been held
    at least once. Each attribute name in this classad is
    a NumHoldByReason label; see the table above under 
    the documentation for job attribute ``HoldReasonCode`` for a table of possible values. Each attribute
    value is an integer stating how many times the job went on hold for that specific reason.  An example:

    .. code-block:: condor-classad

        NumHoldsByReason = [ UserRequest = 2; JobPolicy = 110; UnableToOpenInput = 1 ]

:index:`NumJobCompletions<single: NumJobCompletions; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; NumJobCompletions>`

``NumJobCompletions``
    An integer, initialized to zero, that is incremented by the
    *condor_shadow* each time the job's executable exits of its own
    accord, with or without errors, and successfully completes file
    transfer (if requested). Jobs which have done so normally enter the
    completed state; this attribute is therefore normally only of use
    when, for example, ``on_exit_remove`` or ``on_exit_hold`` is set.

:index:`NumJobMatches<single: NumJobMatches; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; NumJobMatches>`

``NumJobMatches``
    An integer that is incremented by the *condor_schedd* each time the
    job is matched with a resource ad by the negotiator.

:index:`NumJobReconnects<single: NumJobReconnects; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; NumJobReconnects>`

``NumJobReconnects``
    An integer count of the number of times a job successfully
    reconnected after being disconnected. This occurs when the
    *condor_shadow* and *condor_starter* lose contact, for example
    because of transient network failures or a *condor_shadow* or
    *condor_schedd* restart. This attribute is only defined for jobs
    that can reconnected: those in the **vanilla** and **java**
    universes. :index:`NumJobStarts<single: NumJobStarts; ClassAd job attribute>`

:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; NumJobStarts>`

``NumJobStarts``
    An integer count of the number of times the job started executing.

:index:`NumPids<single: NumPids; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; NumPids>`

``NumPids``
    A count of the number of child processes that this job has.

:index:`NumRestarts<single: NumRestarts; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; NumRestarts>`

``NumRestarts``
    A count of the number of restarts from a checkpoint attempted by
    this job during its lifetime.

:index:`NumShadowExceptions<single: NumShadowExceptions; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; NumShadowExceptions>`

``NumShadowExceptions``
    An integer count of the number of times the *condor_shadow* daemon
    had a fatal error for a given job.

:index:`NumShadowStarts<single: NumShadowStarts; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; NumShadowStarts>`

``NumShadowStarts``
    An integer count of the number of times a *condor_shadow* daemon
    was started for a given job. This attribute is not defined for
    **scheduler** universe jobs, since they do not have a
    *condor_shadow* daemon associated with them. For **local** universe
    jobs, this attribute is defined, even though the process that
    manages the job is technically a *condor_starter* rather than a
    *condor_shadow*. This keeps the management of the local universe
    and other universes as similar as possible. **Note that this
    attribute is incremented every time the job is matched, even if the
    match is rejected by the execute machine; in other words, the value
    of this attribute may be greater than the number of times the job
    actually ran.**

:index:`NumSystemHolds<single: NumSystemHolds; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; NumSystemHolds>`

``NumSystemHolds``
    An integer that is incremented each time HTCondor-G places a job on
    hold due to some sort of error condition. This counter is useful,
    since HTCondor-G will always place a job on hold when it gives up on
    some error condition. Note that if the user places the job on hold
    using the *condor_hold* command, this attribute is not incremented.

:index:`OtherJobRemoveRequirements<single: OtherJobRemoveRequirements; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; OtherJobRemoveRequirements>`

``OtherJobRemoveRequirements``
    A string that defines a list of jobs. When the job with this
    attribute defined is removed, all other jobs defined by the list are
    also removed. The string is an expression that defines a constraint
    equivalent to the one implied by the command

    .. code-block:: console

          $ condor_rm -constraint <constraint>

    This attribute is used for jobs managed with *condor_dagman* to
    ensure that node jobs of the DAG are removed when the
    *condor_dagman* job itself is removed. Note that the list of jobs
    defined by this attribute must not form a cyclic removal of jobs, or
    the *condor_schedd* will go into an infinite loop when any of the
    jobs is removed.

:index:`OutputDestination<single: OutputDestination; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; OutputDestination>`


``OutputDestination``
    A URL, as defined by submit command **output_destination**.

:index:`Owner<single: Owner; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; Owner>`

``Owner``
    String describing the user who submitted this job.

:index:`ParallelShutdownPolicy<single: ParallelShutdownPolicy; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; ParallelShutdownPolicy>`

``ParallelShutdownPolicy``
    A string that is only relevant to parallel universe jobs. Without
    this attribute defined, the default policy applied to parallel
    universe jobs is to consider the whole job completed when the first
    node exits, killing processes running on all remaining nodes. If
    defined to the following strings, HTCondor's behavior changes:

     ``"WAIT_FOR_ALL"``
        HTCondor will wait until every node in the parallel job has
        completed to consider the job finished.

``PostArgs``
    Defines the command-line arguments for the post command using the

``PostArguments``
    Defines the command-line arguments for the post command using the

    double quotes must be escaped with a backslash instead of another
    double quote. If both ``PostArgs`` and ``PostArguments`` exists, the
    former is ignored. :index:`PostCmd<single: PostCmd; ClassAd job attribute>`

:index:`ClassAd job attribute<single: ClassAd job attribute; PostCmd>`

``PostCmd``
    A job in the vanilla, Docker, Java, or virtual machine universes may
    specify a command to run after the
    **Executable** :index:`Executable<single: Executable; submit commands>` has
    exited, but before file transfer is started. Unlike a DAGMan POST
    script command, this command is run on the execute machine; however,
    it is not run in the same environment as the
    **Executable** :index:`Executable<single: Executable; submit commands>`.
    Instead, its environment is set by ``PostEnv`` or
    ``PostEnvironment``. Like the DAGMan POST script command, this
    command is not run in the same universe as the
    **Executable** :index:`Executable<single: Executable; submit commands>`; in
    particular, this command is not run in a Docker container, nor in a
    virtual machine, nor in Java. This command is also not run with any
    of vanilla universe's features active, including (but not limited
    to): cgroups, PID namespaces, bind mounts, CPU affinity,
    Singularity, or job wrappers. This command is not automatically
    transferred with the job, so if you're using file transfer, you must
    add it to the
    **transfer_input_files** :index:`transfer_input_files<single: transfer_input_files; submit commands>`
    list.

    If the specified command is in the job's execute directory, or any
    sub-directory, you should not set
    **vm_no_output_vm** :index:`vm_no_output_vm<single: vm_no_output_vm; submit commands>`,
    as that will delete all the files in the job's execute directory
    before this command has a chance to run. If you don't want any
    output back from your VM universe job, but you do want to run a post
    command, do not set
    **vm_no_output_vm** :index:`vm_no_output_vm<single: vm_no_output_vm; submit commands>`
    and instead delete the job's execute directory in your post command.

    Note that this number does not get reset to zero when a job is
    forced to migrate from one machine to another. ``CommittedTime``, on
    the other hand, is just like ``RemoteWallClockTime`` except it does
    get reset to 0 whenever the job is evicted without a checkpoint.

``DAG_NodesTotal``
    The total number of nodes in the DAG, including the FINAL node, if
    there is a FINAL node.

:index:`DAG_NodesUnready<single: DAG_NodesUnready; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; DAG_NodesUnready>`

``DAG_NodesUnready``
    The number of DAG nodes that are not ready to run. This is a node in
    which one or more of the parent nodes has not yet finished.

The following job ClassAd attributes do not appear in the job ClassAd as
kept by the *condor_schedd* daemon. They appear in the job ClassAd
written to the job's execute directory while the job is running.

:index:`CpusProvisioned<single: CpusProvisioned; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; CpusProvisioned>`


``CpusProvisioned``
    The number of Cpus allocated to the job. With statically-allocated
    slots, it is the number of Cpus allocated to the slot. With
    dynamically-allocated slots, it is based upon the job attribute
    ``RequestCpus``, but may be larger due to the minimum given to a
    dynamic slot.

:index:`CpusUsage<single: CpusUsage; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; CpusUsage>`


``CpusUsage``
    CpusUsage (Note the plural `Cpus`) is a floating point value that 
    represents the number of cpu cores fully used over the lifetime of
    the job.  A cpu-bound, single-threaded job will have a CpusUsage of 1.0.
    A job that is blocked on I/O for half of its life and is cpu bound
    for the other have will have a CpusUsage of 0.5.  A job that uses two
    cores fully will have a CpusUsage of 2.0.  Jobs with unexpectedly low 
    CpusUsage may be showing lowered throughput due to blocking on network or disk.

:index:`DiskProvisioned<single: DiskProvisioned; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; DiskProvisioned>`

``DiskProvisioned``
    The amount of disk space in KiB allocated to the job. With
    statically-allocated slots, it is the amount of disk space allocated
    to the slot. With dynamically-allocated slots, it is based upon the
    job attribute ``RequestDisk``, but may be larger due to the minimum
    given to a dynamic slot.

:index:`MemoryProvisioned<single: MemoryProvisioned; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; MemoryProvisioned>`

``MemoryProvisioned``
    The amount of memory in MiB allocated to the job. With
    statically-allocated slots, it is the amount of memory space
    allocated to the slot. With dynamically-allocated slots, it is based
    upon the job attribute ``RequestMemory``, but may be larger due to
    the minimum given to a dynamic slot.

:index:`<Name>Provisioned<single: <Name>Provisioned; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; <Name>Provisioned>`

``<Name>Provisioned``
    The amount of the custom resource identified by ``<Name>`` allocated
    to the job. For jobs using GPUs, ``<Name>`` will be ``GPUs``. With
    statically-allocated slots, it is the amount of the resource
    allocated to the slot. With dynamically-allocated slots, it is based
    upon the job attribute ``Request<Name>``, but may be larger due to
    the minimum given to a dynamic slot.
