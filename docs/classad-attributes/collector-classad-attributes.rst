Collector ClassAd Attributes
============================

:classad-attribute-def:`ActiveQueryWorkers`
    Current number of forked child processes handling queries.

:classad-attribute-def:`ActiveQueryWorkersPeak`
    Peak number of forked child processes handling queries since
    collector startup or statistics reset.

:index:`RecentDroppedQueries (ClassAd Collector Attribute)`

:classad-attribute-def:`DroppedQueries`
    Total number of queries aborted since collector startup (or
    statistics reset) because :macro:`COLLECTOR_QUERY_WORKERS_PENDING`
    exceeded, or :macro:`COLLECTOR_QUERY_MAX_WORKTIME` exceeded, or client
    closed TCP socket while request was pending. This statistic is also
    available as ``RecentDroppedQueries`` which represents a count of
    recently dropped queries that occurred within a recent time window
    (default of 20 minutes).

:classad-attribute-def:`CollectorIpAddr`
    String with the IP and port address of the *condor_collector*
    daemon which is publishing this ClassAd.

    A string containing the HTCondor version number, the release date,
    and the build identification number.

:classad-attribute-def:`CurrentForkWorkers`
    The current number of active forks of the Collector. The Windows
    version of the Collector does not fork and will not have this
    statistic.

    universes.

:classad-attribute-def:`CurrentJobsRunning`
