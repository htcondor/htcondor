DAGMan Workflows
================

:index:`DAGMan` :index:`directed acyclic graph (DAG)`
:index:`Directed Acyclic Graph Manager (DAGMan)`
:index:`dependencies within<single: dependencies within; job>`

DAGMan is a HTCondor tool that allows multiple jobs to be organized in
**workflows**, represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A DAGMan workflow
automatically submits jobs in a particular order, such that certain jobs need
to complete before others start running. This allows the outputs of some jobs
to be used as inputs for others, and makes it easy to replicate a workflow
multiple times in the future.

Describing Workflows with DAGMan
--------------------------------

:index:`DAG input file<single: DAG input file; DAGMan>`

A DAGMan workflow is described in a **DAG input file**. The input file specifies
the nodes of the DAG as well as the dependencies that order the DAG.

A **node** within a DAG represents a unit of work. It contains the following:

-   **Job**: An HTCondor job, defined in a submit file.
-   **PRE script** (optional): A script that runs before the job starts.
    Typically used to verify that all inputs are valid.
-   **POST script** (optional): A script that runs after the job finishes.
    Typically used to verify outputs and clean up temporary files.

The following diagram illustrates the elements of a node:

.. figure:: /_images/dagman-node.png
    :width: 400
    :alt: One Node within a DAG
    :align: center

    One Node within a DAG

An **edge** in DAGMan describes a dependency between two nodes. DAG edges are 
directional; each has a **parent** and a **child**, where the parent node must
finish running before the child starts. Any node can have an unlimited number
of parents and children.
 

Example: Diamond DAG
''''''''''''''''''''

A simple diamond-shaped DAG, as shown in the following image
is presented as a starting point for examples. This DAG contains 4
nodes.

.. figure:: /_images/dagman-diamond-dag.png
    :width: 300
    :alt: Diamond DAG
    :align: center

    Diamond DAG

A very simple DAG input file for this diamond-shaped DAG is:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File name: diamond.dag

    JOB  A  A.condor
    JOB  B  B.condor
    JOB  C  C.condor
    JOB  D  D.condor
    PARENT A CHILD B C
    PARENT B C CHILD D

A set of basic commands appearing in a DAG input file is described
below.

JOB
'''

:index:`JOB command<single: JOB command; DAG input file>`

The **JOB** command specifies an HTCondor job. The syntax used for each
*JOB* command is:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    JOB JobName SubmitDescriptionFileName [DIR directory] [NOOP] [DONE]

A *JOB* entry maps a *JobName* to an HTCondor submit description file.
The *JobName* uniquely identifies nodes within the DAG input file and in
output messages. Each node name, given by *JobName*, within the DAG must
be unique.

The values defined for *JobName* and *SubmitDescriptionFileName* are case
sensitive, as file names in a file system are case sensitive. The
*JobName* can be any string that contains no white space, except for the
strings *PARENT* and *CHILD* (in upper, lower, or mixed case). *JobName*
also cannot contain special characters (*'.'*, *'+'*) which are reserved
for system use.

The optional *DIR* keyword specifies a working directory for this node,
from which the HTCondor job will be submitted, and from which a *PRE*
and/or *POST* script will be run. If a relative directory is specified,
it is relative to the current working directory as the DAG is submitted.
Note that a DAG containing *DIR* specifications cannot be run in
conjunction with the *-usedagdir* command-line argument to
*condor_submit_dag*. 

The optional *NOOP* keyword identifies that the HTCondor job within the
node is not to be submitted to HTCondor. This is useful for 
debugging a complex DAG structure, by marking jobs as *NOOP* s to verify
that the control flow through the DAG is correct. The *NOOP* keywords
are then removed before submitting the DAG. Any PRE and POST scripts for
jobs specified with *NOOP* are executed; to avoid running the PRE and
POST scripts, comment them out. Even though the job specified with *NOOP*
is not submitted, its submit description file must still exist.

The optional *DONE* keyword identifies a node as being already
completed. This is mainly used by Rescue DAGs generated by DAGMan
itself, in the event of a failure to complete the workflow. Users should
generally not use the *DONE* keyword. The *NOOP* keyword is more
flexible in avoiding the execution of a job within a node. 

DATA
''''

:index:`DATA command<single: DATA command; DAG input file>`

As of version 8.3.5, *condor_dagman* no longer supports DATA nodes.

PARENT ... CHILD ...
''''''''''''''''''''

:index:`PARENT CHILD command<single: PARENT CHILD command; DAG input file>`

The **PARENT ... CHILD ...** command specifies the dependencies within the DAG.
:index:`describing dependencies<single: describing dependencies; DAGMan>`\ Nodes are parents
and/or children within the DAG. A parent node must be completed
successfully before any of its children may be started. A child node may
only be started once all its parents have successfully completed.

The syntax used for each dependency (PARENT/CHILD) command is

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    PARENT ParentJobName [ParentJobName2 ... ] CHILD  ChildJobName [ChildJobName2 ... ]

The *PARENT* keyword is followed by one or more *ParentJobName*s. The
*CHILD* keyword is followed by one or more *ChildJobName* s. Each child
job depends on every parent job within the line. A single line in the
input file can specify the dependencies from one or more parents to one
or more children. The diamond-shaped DAG example may specify the
dependencies with

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    PARENT A CHILD B C
    PARENT B C CHILD D

An alternative specification for the diamond-shaped DAG may specify some
or all of the dependencies on separate lines:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    PARENT A CHILD B C
    PARENT B CHILD D
    PARENT C CHILD D

As a further example, the line

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    PARENT p1 p2 CHILD c1 c2

produces four dependencies:

#. p1 to c1
#. p1 to c2
#. p2 to c1
#. p2 to c2

SCRIPT
''''''

The optional *SCRIPT* command specifies processing that is done either
before a job within a node is submitted, after a job within a node
completes its execution, or when a job goes on hold.

PRE and POST scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:index:`SCRIPT command<single: SCRIPT command; DAG input file>`
:index:`PRE and POST scripts<single: PRE and POST scripts; DAGMan>`

:index:`PRE script<single: PRE script; DAGMan>` Processing
done before a job is submitted is called a *PRE* script. Processing done
after a job completes its execution is
:index:`POST script<single: POST script; DAGMan>` called a *POST* script. Note that
the executable specified does not necessarily have to be a shell script
(Unix) or batch file (Windows); but it should be relatively light weight
because it will be run directly on the submit machine, not submitted as
an HTCondor job.

The syntax used for each *PRE* or *POST* command is

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    SCRIPT [DEFER status time] PRE <JobName | ALL_NODES> ExecutableName [arguments]

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    SCRIPT [DEFER status time] POST <JobName | ALL_NODES> ExecutableName [arguments]

The *SCRIPT* command can use the *PRE* or *POST* keyword, which specifies
the relative timing of when the script is to be run. The *JobName*
identifies the node to which the script is attached. The
*ExecutableName* specifies the executable (e.g., shell script or batch
file) to be executed, and may not contain spaces. The optional
*arguments* are command line arguments to the script, and spaces delimit
the arguments. Both *ExecutableName* and optional *arguments* are case
sensitive.

A PRE script is commonly used to place files in a staging area for the
jobs to use. A POST script is commonly used to clean up or remove files
once jobs are finished running. An example uses PRE and POST scripts to
stage files that are stored on tape. The PRE script reads compressed
input files from the tape drive, uncompresses them, and places the
resulting files in the current directory. The HTCondor jobs can then use
these files, producing output files. The POST script compresses the
output files, writes them out to the tape, and then removes both the
staged files and the output files.

HOLD scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^

:index:`HOLD script<single: HOLD script; DAGMan>`

Additionally, the *SCRIPT* command can take a *HOLD* keyword, which indicates an
executable to be run when a job goes on hold. These are typically used to
notify a user when something goes wrong with their jobs.

The syntax used for a *HOLD* command is

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    SCRIPT [DEFER status time] HOLD <JobName | ALL_NODES> ExecutableName [arguments]

Unlike *PRE* and *POST* scripts, *HOLD* scripts are not considered part of the
DAG workflow and are run on a best-effort basis. If one does not complete
successfully, it has no effect on the overall workflow and no error will be
reported.

DEFER retries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The optional *DEFER* feature causes a retry of only the script, if the
execution of the script exits with the exit code given by *status*. The
retry occurs after at least *time* seconds, rather than being considered
failed. While waiting for the retry, the script does not count against a
*maxpre* or *maxpost* limit. The ordering of the *DEFER* feature within
the *SCRIPT* specification is fixed. It must come directly after the
*SCRIPT* keyword; this is done to avoid backward compatibility issues
for any DAG with a *JobName* of DEFER.

Scripts as part of a DAG workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Scripts are executed on the submit machine; the submit machine is not
necessarily the same machine upon which the node's job is run. Further,
a single cluster of HTCondor jobs may be spread across several machines.

If the PRE script fails, then the HTCondor job associated with the node
is not submitted, and (as of version 8.5.4) the POST script is not run
either (by default). However, if the job is submitted, and there is a
POST script, the POST script is always run once the job finishes. (The
behavior when the PRE script fails may may be changed to run the POST
script by setting configuration variable ``DAGMAN_ALWAYS_RUN_POST`` to
``True`` or by passing the **-AlwaysRunPost** argument to
*condor_submit_dag*.)

Progress towards completion of the DAG is based upon the success of the
nodes within the DAG. The success of a node is based upon the success of
the job(s), PRE script, and POST script. A job, PRE script, or POST
script with an exit value not equal to 0 is considered failed. **The
exit value of whatever component of the node was run last determines the
success or failure of the node.** Table 2.1 lists
the definition of node success and failure for all variations of script
and job success and failure, when ``DAGMAN_ALWAYS_RUN_POST`` is set to
``False``. In this table, a dash (``-``) represents the case where a
script does not exist for the DAG, **S** represents success, and **F**
represents failure. Table 2.2 lists the definition of node success and
failure only for the cases where the PRE script fails, when
``DAGMAN_ALWAYS_RUN_POST`` is set to ``True``.

Special script argument macros
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The five macros ``$JOB``, ``$RETRY``, ``$MAX_RETRIES``, ``$DAG_STATUS``
and ``$FAILED_COUNT`` can be used within the DAG input file as arguments
passed to a PRE or POST script. The three macros ``$JOBID``,
``$RETURN``, and ``$PRE_SCRIPT_RETURN`` can be used as arguments to POST
scripts. The use of these variables is limited to being used as an
individual command line *argument* to the script, surrounded by spaces,
in order to cause the substitution of the variable's value.

The special macros are as follows:

-  ``$JOB`` evaluates to the (case sensitive) string defined for
   *JobName*.
-  ``$RETRY`` evaluates to an integer value set to 0 the first time a
   node is run, and is incremented each time the node is retried. See
   :ref:`users-manual/dagman-workflows:advanced features of dagman` for
   the description of how to cause nodes to be retried.
-  ``$MAX_RETRIES`` evaluates to an integer value set to the maximum
   number of retries for the node. See
   :ref:`users-manual/dagman-workflows:advanced features of dagman` for the
   description of how to cause nodes to be retried. If no retries are set for
   the node, ``$MAX_RETRIES`` will be set to 0.
-  :index:`defined for a DAGMan node job<single: defined for a DAGMan node job; job ID>`\ :index:`defined for a DAGMan node job<single: defined for a DAGMan node job; job ID>`
   ``$JOBID`` (for POST scripts only) evaluates to a representation of
   the HTCondor job ID of the node job. It is the value of the job
   ClassAd attribute ``ClusterId``, followed by a period, and then
   followed by the value of the job ClassAd attribute ``ProcId``. An
   example of a job ID might be 1234.0. For nodes with multiple jobs in
   the same cluster, the ``ProcId`` value is the one of the last job
   within the cluster.
-  ``$RETURN`` (for POST scripts only) variable evaluates to the return
   value of the HTCondor job, if there is a single job within a cluster.
   With multiple jobs within the same cluster, there are two cases to
   consider. In the first case, all jobs within the cluster are
   successful; the value of ``$RETURN`` will be 0, indicating success.
   In the second case, one or more jobs from the cluster fail. When
   *condor_dagman* sees the first terminated event for a job that
   failed, it assigns that job's return value as the value of
   ``$RETURN``, and it attempts to remove all remaining jobs within the
   cluster. Therefore, if multiple jobs in the cluster fail with
   different exit codes, a race condition determines which exit code
   gets assigned to ``$RETURN``.

   A job that dies due to a signal is reported with a ``$RETURN`` value
   representing the additive inverse of the signal number. For example,
   SIGKILL (signal 9) is reported as -9. A job whose batch system
   submission fails is reported as -1001. A job that is externally
   removed from the batch system queue (by something other than
   *condor_dagman*) is reported as -1002.

-  ``$PRE_SCRIPT_RETURN`` (for POST scripts only) variable evaluates to
   the return value of the PRE script of a node, if there is one. If
   there is no PRE script, this value will be -1. If the node job was
   skipped because of failure of the PRE script, the value of
   ``$RETURN`` will be -1004 and the value of ``$PRE_SCRIPT_RETURN``
   will be the exit value of the PRE script; the POST script can use
   this to see if the PRE script exited with an error condition, and
   assign success or failure to the node, as appropriate.
-  ``$DAG_STATUS`` is the status of the DAG. Note that this macro's
   value and definition is unrelated to the attribute named
   ``DagStatus`` as defined for use in a node status file. This macro's
   value is the same as the job ClassAd attribute ``DAG_Status`` that is
   defined within the *condor_dagman* job's ClassAd. This macro may
   have the following values:

   -  0: OK
   -  1: error; an error condition different than those listed here
   -  2: one or more nodes in the DAG have failed
   -  3: the DAG has been aborted by an ABORT-DAG-ON specification
   -  4: removed; the DAG has been removed by *condor_rm*
   -  5: cycle; a cycle was found in the DAG
   -  6: halted; the DAG has been halted
      (see :ref:`users-manual/dagman-workflows:suspending a running dag`)

-  ``$FAILED_COUNT`` is defined by the number of nodes that have failed
   in the DAG.

Examples that use PRE or POST scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Examples use the diamond-shaped DAG. A first example uses a PRE script
to expand a compressed file needed as input to each of the HTCondor jobs
of nodes B and C. The DAG input file:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File name: diamond.dag

    JOB  A  A.condor
    JOB  B  B.condor
    JOB  C  C.condor
    JOB  D  D.condor
    SCRIPT PRE  B  pre.sh $JOB .gz
    SCRIPT PRE  C  pre.sh $JOB .gz
    PARENT A CHILD B C
    PARENT B C CHILD D

The script ``pre.sh`` uses its command line arguments to form the file
name of the compressed file. The script contains

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/sh
    gunzip ${1}${2}

Therefore, the PRE script invokes

.. code-block:: bash

    gunzip B.gz

for node B, which uncompresses file ``B.gz``, placing the result in file ``B``.

A second example uses the ``$RETURN`` macro. The DAG input file contains
the POST script specification:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    SCRIPT POST A stage-out job_status $RETURN

If the HTCondor job of node A exits with the value -1, the POST script
is invoked as

.. code-block:: text

    stage-out job_status -1

The slightly different example POST script specification in the DAG
input file

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    SCRIPT POST A stage-out job_status=$RETURN

invokes the POST script with

.. code-block:: text

    stage-out job_status=$RETURN

This example shows that when there is no space between the ``=`` sign
and the variable ``$RETURN``, there is no substitution of the macro's
value.

PRE_SKIP
''''''''

:index:`PRE_SKIP command<single: PRE_SKIP command; DAG input file>`
:index:`skipping node execution<single: skipping node execution; DAGMan>`

The behavior of DAGMan with respect to node success or failure can be
changed with the addition of a *PRE_SKIP* command. A *PRE_SKIP* line
within the DAG input file uses the syntax:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    PRE_SKIP <JobName | ALL_NODES> non-zero-exit-code

The PRE script of a node identified by *JobName* that exits with the
value given by *non-zero-exit-code* skips the remainder of the node
entirely. Neither the job associated with the node nor the POST script
will be executed, and the node will be marked as successful.

Node Job Submit File Contents
-----------------------------

:index:`node job submit description file<single: node job submit description file; DAGMan>`

Each node in a DAG may use a unique submit description file. A key
limitation is that each HTCondor submit description file must submit
jobs described by a single cluster number; DAGMan cannot deal with a
submit description file producing multiple job clusters.

Consider again the diamond-shaped DAG example, where each node job uses
the same submit description file.

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File name: diamond.dag

    JOB  A  diamond_job.condor
    JOB  B  diamond_job.condor
    JOB  C  diamond_job.condor
    JOB  D  diamond_job.condor
    PARENT A CHILD B C
    PARENT B C CHILD D

Here is a sample HTCondor submit description file for this DAG:
:index:`example submit description file<single: example submit description file; DAGMan>`

.. code-block:: condor-submit

    # File name: diamond_job.condor

    executable   = /path/diamond.exe
    output       = diamond.out.$(cluster)
    error        = diamond.err.$(cluster)
    log          = diamond_condor.log
    universe     = vanilla
    queue

Since each node uses the same HTCondor submit description file, this
implies that each node within the DAG runs the same job. The
``$(Cluster)`` macro produces unique file names for each job's output.
:index:`DAGParentNodeNames<single: DAGParentNodeNames; ClassAd job attribute>`
:index:`job ClassAd attribute<single: job ClassAd attribute; DAGParentNodeNames>`

The job ClassAd attribute ``DAGParentNodeNames`` is also available for
use within the submit description file. It defines a comma separated
list of each *JobName* which is a parent node of this job's node. This
attribute may be used in the
**arguments** :index:`arguments<single: arguments; submit commands>` command for
all but scheduler universe jobs. For example, if the job has two
parents, with *JobName* s B and C, the submit description file command

.. code-block:: condor-submit

    arguments = $$([DAGParentNodeNames])

will pass the string ``"B,C"`` as the command line argument when
invoking the job.

DAGMan supports jobs with queues of multiple procs, so for example:

.. code-block:: condor-submit

    queue 500

will queue 500 procs as expected.

Inline Submit Descriptions
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Instead of using a submit description file, you can alternatively include an
inline submit description directly inside the .dag file. An inline submit
description should be wrapped in ``{`` and ``}`` braces, with each argument
appearing on a separate line, just like the contents of a regular submit file.
Using the previous diamond-shaped DAG example, the diamond.dag file would look
like this:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

        # File name: diamond.dag

        JOB  A  {
            executable   = /path/diamond.exe
            output       = diamond.out.$(cluster)
            error        = diamond.err.$(cluster)
            log          = diamond_condor.log
            universe     = vanilla
        }
        JOB  B  {
            executable   = /path/diamond.exe
            output       = diamond.out.$(cluster)
            error        = diamond.err.$(cluster)
            log          = diamond_condor.log
            universe     = vanilla
        }
        JOB  C  {
            executable   = /path/diamond.exe
            output       = diamond.out.$(cluster)
            error        = diamond.err.$(cluster)
            log          = diamond_condor.log
            universe     = vanilla
        }
        JOB  D  {
            executable   = /path/diamond.exe
            output       = diamond.out.$(cluster)
            error        = diamond.err.$(cluster)
            log          = diamond_condor.log
            universe     = vanilla
        }
        PARENT A CHILD B C
        PARENT B C CHILD D

This can be helpful when trying to manage lots of submit descriptions, so they
can all be described in the same file instead of needed to regularly shift
between many files.

The main drawback of using inline submit descriptions is that they do not
support the ``queue`` statement or any variations thereof. Any job described 
inline in the .dag file will only have a single instance submitted.

SUBMIT-DESCRIPTION command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to declaring inline submit descriptions as part of a job, they
can be declared independently of jobs using the *SUBMIT-DESCRIPTION* command.
This can be helpful to reduce the size and readability of a .dag file when
many nodes are running the same job.

A *SUBMIT-DESCRIPTION* can be defined using the following syntax:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    SUBMIT-DESCRIPTION DescriptionName {
        # submit attributes go here
    }

An independently declared submit description must have a unique name that is
not used by any of the jobs. It can then be linked to a job as follows:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    JOB JobName DescriptionName

For example, the previous diamond.dag example could be written as follows:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File name: diamond.dag

    SUBMIT-DESCRIPTION DiamondDesc  {
        executable   = /path/diamond.exe
        output       = diamond.out.$(cluster)
        error        = diamond.err.$(cluster)
        log          = diamond_condor.log
        universe     = vanilla
    }

    JOB A DiamondDesc
    JOB B DiamondDesc
    JOB C DiamondDesc
    JOB D DiamondDesc

    PARENT A CHILD B C
    PARENT B C CHILD D






DAG Submission
--------------

:index:`DAG submission<single: DAG submission; DAGMan>`

A DAG is submitted using the tool *condor_submit_dag*. The manual
page for :doc:`/man-pages/condor_submit_dag` details the
command. The simplest of DAG submissions has the syntax

.. code-block:: console

    $ condor_submit_dag DAGInputFileName

and the current working directory contains the DAG input file.

The diamond-shaped DAG example may be submitted with

.. code-block:: console

    $ condor_submit_dag diamond.dag

Do not submit the same DAG, with same DAG input file, from within the
same directory, such that more than one of this same DAG is running at
the same time. It will fail in an unpredictable manner, as each instance
of this same DAG will attempt to use the same file to enforce
dependencies.

To increase robustness and guarantee recoverability, the
*condor_dagman* process is run as an HTCondor job. As such, it needs a
submit description file. *condor_submit_dag* generates this needed
submit description file, naming it by appending ``.condor.sub`` to the
name of the DAG input file. This submit description file may be edited
if the DAG is submitted with

.. code-block:: console

    $ condor_submit_dag -no_submit diamond.dag

causing *condor_submit_dag* to create the submit description file, but
not submit *condor_dagman* to HTCondor. To submit the DAG, once the
submit description file is edited, use

.. code-block:: console

    $ condor_submit diamond.dag.condor.sub

Submit machines with limited resources are supported by command line
options that place limits on the submission and handling of HTCondor
jobs and PRE and POST scripts. Presented here are descriptions of the
command line options to *condor_submit_dag*. These same limits can be
set in configuration. Each limit is applied within a single DAG.

DAG Throttling
''''''''''''''

:index:`throttling<single: throttling; DAGMan>`

*   **Total nodes/clusters:** The **-maxjobs** option specifies the maximum
    number of clusters that *condor_dagman* can submit at one time. Since
    each node corresponds to a single cluster, this limit restricts the
    number of nodes that can be submitted (in the HTCondor queue) at a time.
    It is commonly used when there is a limited amount of input file staging
    capacity. As a specific example, consider a case where each node
    represents a single HTCondor proc that requires 4 MB of input files, and
    the proc will run in a directory with a volume of 100 MB of free space.
    Using the argument **-maxjobs 25** guarantees that a maximum of 25
    clusters, using a maximum of 100 MB of space, will be submitted to
    HTCondor at one time. (See the :doc:`/man-pages/condor_submit_dag` manual
    page) for more information.
    Also see the equivalent ``DAGMAN_MAX_JOBS_SUBMITTED``
    :index:`DAGMAN_MAX_JOBS_SUBMITTED` configuration option
    (ref:`admin-manual/configuration-macros:configuration file entries for dagman`).

*   **Idle procs:** The number of idle procs within a given DAG can be
    limited with the optional command line argument **-maxidle**.
    *condor_dagman* will not submit any more node jobs until the number of
    idle procs in the DAG goes below this specified value, even if there are
    ready nodes in the DAG. This allows *condor_dagman* to submit jobs in a
    way that adapts to the load on the HTCondor pool at any given time. If
    the pool is lightly loaded, *condor_dagman* will end up submitting more
    jobs; if the pool is heavily loaded, *condor_dagman* will submit fewer
    jobs. (See the :doc:`/man-pages/condor_submit_dag` manual page for more
    information.)
    Also see the equivalent ``DAGMAN_MAX_JOBS_IDLE``
    :index:`DAGMAN_MAX_JOBS_IDLE` configuration option
    (ref:`admin-manual/configuration-macros:configuration file entries for dagman`).

*   **Subsets of nodes:** Node submission can also be throttled in a
    finer-grained manner by grouping nodes into categories. See section
    :ref:`users-manual/dagman-workflows:advanced features of dagman` for
    more details.

*   **PRE/POST scripts:** Since PRE and POST scripts run on the submit
    machine, it may be desirable to limit the number of PRE or POST scripts
    running at one time. The optional **-maxpre** command line argument
    limits the number of PRE scripts that may be running at one time, and
    the optional **-maxpost** command line argument limits the number of
    POST scripts that may be running at one time. (See the
    :doc:`/man-pages/condor_submit_dag` manual page for more information.)
    Also see the equivalent
    ``DAGMAN_MAX_PRE_SCRIPTS`` :index:`DAGMAN_MAX_PRE_SCRIPTS` and
    ``DAGMAN_MAX_POST_SCRIPTS`` :index:`DAGMAN_MAX_POST_SCRIPTS`
    (ref:`admin-manual/configuration-macros:configuration file entries for dagman`)
    configuration options.

File Paths in DAGs
------------------

:index:`file paths in DAGs<single: file paths in DAGs; DAGMan>`

*condor_dagman* assumes that all relative paths in a DAG input file and
the associated HTCondor submit description files are relative to the
current working directory when *condor_submit_dag* is run. This works
well for submitting a single DAG. It presents problems when multiple
independent DAGs are submitted with a single invocation of
*condor_submit_dag*. Each of these independent DAGs would logically be
in its own directory, such that it could be run or tested independent of
other DAGs. Thus, all references to files will be designed to be
relative to the DAG's own directory.

Consider an example DAG within a directory named ``dag1``. There would
be a DAG input file, named ``one.dag`` for this example. Assume the
contents of this DAG input file specify a node job with

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

      JOB A  A.submit

Further assume that partial contents of submit description file
``A.submit`` specify

.. code-block:: condor-submit

      executable = programA
      input      = A.input

Directory contents are

.. code-block:: text

    dag1/
    ├── A.input
    ├── A.submit
    ├── one.dag
    └── programA


All file paths are correct relative to the ``dag1`` directory.
Submission of this example DAG sets the current working directory to
``dag1`` and invokes *condor_submit_dag*:

.. code-block:: console

      $ cd dag1
      $ condor_submit_dag one.dag

Expand this example such that there are now two independent DAGs, and
each is contained within its own directory. For simplicity, assume that
the DAG in ``dag2`` has remarkably similar files and file naming as the
DAG in ``dag1``. Assume that the directory contents are

.. code-block:: text

    parent/
    ├── dag1
    │   ├── A.input
    │   ├── A.submit
    │   ├── one.dag
    │   └── programA
    └── dag2
        ├── B.input
        ├── B.submit
        ├── programB
        └── two.dag


The goal is to use a single invocation of *condor_submit_dag* to run
both dag1 and dag2. The invocation

.. code-block:: console

      $ cd parent
      $ condor_submit_dag dag1/one.dag dag2/two.dag

does not work. Path names are now relative to ``parent``, which is not
the desired behavior.

The solution is the *-usedagdir* command line argument to
*condor_submit_dag*. This feature runs each DAG as if
*condor_submit_dag* had been run in the directory in which the
relevant DAG file exists. A working invocation is

.. code-block:: console

      $ cd parent
      $ condor_submit_dag -usedagdir dag1/one.dag dag2/two.dag

Output files will be placed in the correct directory, and the
``.dagman.out`` file will also be in the correct directory. A Rescue DAG
file will be written to the current working directory, which is the
directory when *condor_submit_dag* is invoked. The Rescue DAG should
be run from that same current working directory. The Rescue DAG includes
all the path information necessary to run each node job in the proper
directory.

Use of *-usedagdir* does not work in conjunction with a JOB node
specification within the DAG input file using the *DIR* keyword. Using
both will be detected and generate an error.

DAG Monitoring
--------------

:index:`DAG monitoring<single: DAG monitoring; DAGMan>`
:index:`DAG removal<single: DAG removal; DAGMan>`

After submission, the progress of the DAG can be monitored by looking at
the job event log file(s) or observing the e-mail that job submission to
HTCondor causes, or by using *condor_q* *-dag*.

Detailed information about a DAG's job progress can be obtained using

.. code-block:: console

    $ condor_q -l <dagman-job-id>

There is also a large amount of information logged in an extra file. The
name of this extra file is produced by appending ``.dagman.out`` to the
name of the DAG input file; for example, if the DAG input file is
``diamond.dag``, this extra file is named ``diamond.dag.dagman.out``. The 
``.dagman.out`` file is an important resource for
debugging; save this file if a problem occurs. The ``dagman.out`` is appended
to, rather than overwritten, with each new DAGMan run.

Editing a Running DAG
---------------------

:index:`editing a running DAG<single: editing a running DAG; DAGMan>`

Certain properties of a running DAG can be changed after the workflow has been
started. The values of these properties are published in the *condor_dagman* 
job ad; changing any of these properties using *condor_qedit* will also update
the internal DAGMan value.

Currently, you can change the following attributes:

+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| **Attribute Name**      | **Attribute Description**                           |
+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| *DAGMan_MaxJobs*        | Maximum number of running jobs                      |
+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| *DAGMan_MaxIdle*        | Maximum number of idle jobs                         |
+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| *DAGMan_MaxPreScripts*  | Maximum number of running PRE scripts               |
+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| *DAGMan_MaxPostScripts* | Maximum number of running POST scripts              |
+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

To edit one of these properties, use the *condor_qedit* tool with the job ID of
the *condor_dagman* job, for example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ condor_qedit <dagman-job-id> DAGMan_MaxJobs 1000

To view all the properties of a *condor_dagman* job:

.. code-block:: console

    $ condor_q -l <dagman-job-id> | grep DAGMan


Removing a DAG
--------------

To remove an entire DAG, consisting of the *condor_dagman* job, plus
any jobs submitted to HTCondor, remove the *condor_dagman* job by
running *condor_rm*. For example,

.. code-block:: console

    $ condor_q
    -- Submitter: turunmaa.cs.wisc.edu : <128.105.175.125:36165> : turunmaa.cs.wisc.edu
     ID      OWNER          SUBMITTED     RUN_TIME ST PRI SIZE CMD
      9.0   taylor         10/12 11:47   0+00:01:32 R  0   8.7  condor_dagman -f -
     11.0   taylor         10/12 11:48   0+00:00:00 I  0   3.6  B.out
     12.0   taylor         10/12 11:48   0+00:00:00 I  0   3.6  C.out

        3 jobs; 2 idle, 1 running, 0 held

    $ condor_rm 9.0

When a *condor_dagman* job is removed, all node jobs (including
sub-DAGs) of that *condor_dagman* will be removed by the
*condor_schedd*. As of version 8.5.8, the default is that
*condor_dagman* itself also removes the node jobs (to fix a race
condition that could result in "orphaned" node jobs). (The
*condor_schedd* has to remove the node jobs to deal with the case of
removing a *condor_dagman* job that has been held.)

The previous behavior of *condor_dagman* itself not removing the node
jobs can be restored by setting the ``DAGMAN_REMOVE_NODE_JOBS``
configuration macro (see
ref:`admin-manual/configuration-macros:configuration file entries for dagman`)
to ``False``. This will decrease the load on the *condor_schedd*, at the cost of
allowing the possibility of "orphaned" node jobs.

A removed DAG will be considered failed unless the DAG has a FINAL node
that succeeds.

In the case where a machine is scheduled to go down, DAGMan will clean
up memory and exit. However, it will leave any submitted jobs in the
HTCondor queue.


Suspending a Running DAG
------------------------

:index:`suspending a running DAG<single: suspending a running DAG; DAGMan>`

It may be desired to temporarily suspend a running DAG. For example, the
load may be high on the submit machine, and therefore it is desired to
prevent DAGMan from submitting any more jobs until the load goes down.
There are two ways to suspend (and resume) a running DAG.

-  Use *condor_hold*/*condor_release* on the *condor_dagman* job.

   After placing the *condor_dagman* job on hold, no new node jobs will
   be submitted, and no PRE or POST scripts will be run. Any node jobs
   already in the HTCondor queue will continue undisturbed. Any running
   PRE or POST scripts will be killed. If the *condor_dagman* job is
   left on hold, it will remain in the HTCondor queue after all of the
   currently running node jobs are finished. To resume the DAG, use
   *condor_release* on the *condor_dagman* job.

   Note that while the *condor_dagman* job is on hold, no updates will
   be made to the ``dagman.out`` file.

-  Use a DAG halt file.

   The second way of suspending a DAG uses the existence of a
   specially-named file to change the state of the DAG. When in this
   halted state, no PRE scripts will be run, and no node jobs will be
   submitted. Running node jobs will continue undisturbed. A halted DAG
   will still run POST scripts, and it will still update the
   ``dagman.out`` file. This differs from behavior of a DAG that is
   held. Furthermore, a halted DAG will not remain in the queue
   indefinitely; when all of the running node jobs have finished, DAGMan
   will create a Rescue DAG and exit.

   To resume a halted DAG, remove the halt file.

   The specially-named file must be placed in the same directory as the
   DAG input file. The naming is the same as the DAG input file
   concatenated with the string ``.halt``. For example, if the DAG input
   file is ``test1.dag``, then ``test1.dag.halt`` will be the required
   name of the halt file.

   As any DAG is first submitted with *condor_submit_dag*, a check is
   made for a halt file. If one exists, it is removed.

**Note that neither condor_hold nor a DAG halt is propagated to sub-DAGs.**
In other words, if you *condor_hold* or create a halt file for a
DAG that has sub-DAGs, any sub-DAGs that are already in the queue will
continue to submit node jobs.

A *condor_hold* or DAG halt does, however, apply to splices, because
they are merged into the parent DAG and controlled by a single
*condor_dagman* instance.

Advanced Features of DAGMan
---------------------------

Retrying Failed Nodes
'''''''''''''''''''''

:index:`RETRY command<single: RETRY command; DAG input file>`
:index:`retrying failed nodes<single: retrying failed nodes; DAGMan>`

DAGMan can retry any failed node in a DAG by specifying the node in the
DAG input file with the *RETRY* command. The use of retry is optional.
The syntax for retry is

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    RETRY <JobName | ALL_NODES> NumberOfRetries [UNLESS-EXIT value]

where *JobName* identifies the node. *NumberOfRetries* is an integer
number of times to retry the node after failure. The implied number of
retries for any node is 0, the same as not having a retry line in the
file. Retry is implemented on nodes, not parts of a node.

The diamond-shaped DAG example may be modified to retry node C:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

        # File name: diamond.dag
    
        JOB  A  A.condor
        JOB  B  B.condor
        JOB  C  C.condor
        JOB  D  D.condor
        PARENT A CHILD B C
        PARENT B C CHILD D
        RETRY  C 3

If node C is marked as failed for any reason, then it is started over as
a first retry. The node will be tried a second and third time, if it
continues to fail. If the node is marked as successful, then further
retries do not occur.

Retry of a node may be short circuited using the optional keyword
*UNLESS-EXIT*, followed by an integer exit value. If the node exits with
the specified integer exit value, then no further processing will be
done on the node.

The macro ``$RETRY`` evaluates to an integer value, set to 0 first time
a node is run, and is incremented each time for each time the node is
retried. The macro ``$MAX_RETRIES`` is the value set for
*NumberOfRetries*. These macros may be used as arguments passed to a PRE
or POST script.

.. _abort-dag-on:

Stopping the Entire DAG
'''''''''''''''''''''''

:index:`ABORT-DAG-ON command<single: ABORT-DAG-ON command; DAG input file>`
:index:`aborting a DAG<single: aborting a DAG; DAGMan>`

The *ABORT-DAG-ON* command provides a way to abort the entire DAG if a
given node returns a specific exit code. The syntax for *ABORT-DAG-ON*
is

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    ABORT-DAG-ON <JobName | ALL_NODES> AbortExitValue [RETURN DAGReturnValue]

If the return value of the node specified by *JobName* matches
*AbortExitValue*, the DAG is immediately aborted. A DAG abort differs
from a node failure, in that a DAG abort causes all nodes within the DAG
to be stopped immediately. This includes removing the jobs in nodes that
are currently running. A node failure differs, as it would allow the DAG
to continue running, until no more progress can be made due to
dependencies.

The behavior differs based on the existence of PRE and/or POST scripts.
If a PRE script returns the *AbortExitValue* value, the DAG is
immediately aborted. If the HTCondor job within a node returns the
*AbortExitValue* value, the DAG is aborted if the node has no POST
script. If the POST script returns the *AbortExitValue* value, the DAG
is aborted.

An abort overrides node retries. If a node returns the abort exit value,
the DAG is aborted, even if the node has retry specified.

When a DAG aborts, by default it exits with the node return value that
caused the abort. This can be changed by using the optional *RETURN*
keyword along with specifying the desired *DAGReturnValue*. The DAG
abort return value can be used for DAGs within DAGs, allowing an inner
DAG to cause an abort of an outer DAG.

A DAG return value other than 0, 1, or 2 will cause the *condor_dagman*
job to stay in the queue after it exits and get retried, unless the
``on_exit_remove`` expression in the ``.condor.sub`` file is manually
modified.

Adding *ABORT-DAG-ON* for node C in the diamond-shaped DAG

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

        # File name: diamond.dag
    
        JOB  A  A.condor
        JOB  B  B.condor
        JOB  C  C.condor
        JOB  D  D.condor
        PARENT A CHILD B C
        PARENT B C CHILD D
        RETRY  C 3
        ABORT-DAG-ON C 10 RETURN 1

causes the DAG to be aborted, if node C exits with a return value of 10.
Any other currently running nodes, of which only node B is a possibility
for this particular example, are stopped and removed. If this abort
occurs, the return value for the DAG is 1.

Variable Values Associated with Nodes
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

:index:`VARS command<single: VARS command; DAG input file>`
:index:`VARS (macro for submit description file)<single: VARS (macro for submit description file); DAGMan>`

Macros defined for DAG nodes can be used within the submit description
file of the node job. The *VARS* command provides a method for defining
a macro. Macros are defined on a per-node basis, using the syntax

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    VARS <JobName | ALL_NODES> [PREPEND | APPEND] macroname="string" [macroname2="string2" ... ]

The macro may be used within the submit description file of the relevant
node. A *macroname* may contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, and
0-9) and the underscore character. The space character delimits macros,
such that there may be more than one macro defined on a single line.
Multiple lines defining macros for the same node are permitted.

Correct syntax requires that the *string* must be enclosed in double
quotes. To use a double quote mark within a *string*, escape the double
quote mark with the backslash character (\\). To add the backslash
character itself, use two backslashes (\\\\).

A restriction is that the *macroname* itself cannot begin with the
string ``queue``, in any combination of upper or lower case letters.

**Examples**

If the DAG input file contains

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File name: diamond.dag

    JOB  A  A.submit
    JOB  B  B.submit
    JOB  C  C.submit
    JOB  D  D.submit
    VARS A state="Wisconsin"
    PARENT A CHILD B C
    PARENT B C CHILD D

then the submit description file ``A.submit`` may use the macro state.
Consider this submit description file ``A.submit``:

.. code-block:: condor-submit

    # file name: A.submit
    executable = A.exe
    log        = A.log
    arguments  = "$(state)"
    queue

The macro value expands to become a command-line argument in the
invocation of the job. The job is invoked with

.. code-block:: text

    A.exe Wisconsin

The use of macros may allow a reduction in the number of distinct submit
description files. A separate example shows this intended use of *VARS*.
In the case where the submit description file for each node varies only
in file naming, macros reduce the number of submit description files to
one.

This example references a single submit description file for each of the
nodes in the DAG input file, and it uses the *VARS* entry to name files
used by each job.

The relevant portion of the DAG input file appears as

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    JOB A theonefile.sub
    JOB B theonefile.sub
    JOB C theonefile.sub

    VARS A filename="A"
    VARS B filename="B"
    VARS C filename="C"

The submit description file appears as

.. code-block:: condor-submit

    # submit description file called:  theonefile.sub
    executable   = progX
    output       = $(filename)
    error        = error.$(filename)
    log          = $(filename).log
    queue

For a DAG such as this one, but with thousands of nodes, the ability to
write and maintain a single submit description file together with a
single, yet more complex, DAG input file is worthwhile.

Prepend or Append Variables to Node
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

After *JobName* the word *PREPEND* or *APPEND* can be added to specify how
a variable is passed to a node at job submission time. *APPEND* will add
the variable after the submit description file is read. Resulting in the
passed variable being added as a macro or overwitting any already existing
variable values. *PREPEND* will add the variable before the submit
description file is read. This allows the variable to be used in submit
description file conditionals.

The relevant portion of the DAG input file appears as

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

     JOB A theotherfile.sub

     VARS A PREPEND var1="A"
     VARS A APPEND  var2="B"

The submit description file appears as

.. code-block:: condor-submit

     # submit description file called:   theotherfile.sub
     executable   = progX

     if defined var1
          # This will occur due to PREPEND
          Arguments = "$(var1) was prepended"
     else
          # This will occur due to APPEND
          Arguments = "No variables prepended"
     endif

     var2 = "C"

     output       = results-$(var2).out
     error        = error.txt
     log          = job.log
     queue

For a DAG such as this one, ``Arguments`` will become "A was prepended" and the
output file will be named ``results-B.out``. If instead var1 used *APPEND*
and var2 used *PREPEND* then ``Arguments`` will become "No variables prepended"
and the output file will be named ``results-C.out``.

If neither *PREPEND* nor *APPEND* is used in the *VARS* line then the variable
will either be prepended or appended based on the configuration variable
``DAGMAN_DEFAULT_APPEND_VARS``.

Multiple macroname definitions
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If a macro name for a specific node in a DAG is defined more than once,
as it would be with the partial file contents

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    JOB job1 job1.submit
    VARS job1 a="foo"
    VARS job1 a="bar"

a warning is written to the log, of the format

.. code-block:: text

    Warning: VAR <macroname> is already defined in job <JobName>
    Discovered at file "<DAG input file name>", line <line number>

The behavior of DAGMan is such that all definitions for the macro exist,
but only the last one defined is used as the variable's value. Using
this example, if the ``job1.submit`` submit description file contains

.. code-block:: condor-submit

    arguments = "$(a)"

then the argument will be ``bar``.

Special characters within VARS string definitions
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

:index:`VARS (use of special characters)<single: VARS (use of special characters); DAGMan>`

The value defined for a macro may contain spaces and tabs. It is also
possible to have double quote marks and backslashes within a value. In
order to have spaces or tabs within a value specified for a command line
argument, use the New Syntax format for the **arguments** submit
command, as described in :doc:`/man-pages/condor_submit`. Escapes for double
quote marks depend on whether the New Syntax or Old Syntax format is
used for the **arguments** submit command. Note that in both syntaxes,
double quote marks require two levels of escaping: one level is for the
parsing of the DAG input file, and the other level is for passing the
resulting value through *condor_submit*.

As of HTCondor version 8.3.7, single quotes are permitted within the
value specification. For the specification of command line
**arguments**, single quotes can be used in three ways:

-  in Old Syntax, within a macro's value specification
-  in New Syntax, within a macro's value specification
-  in New Syntax only, to delimit an argument containing white space

There are examples of all three cases below. In New Syntax, to pass a
single quote as part of an argument, escape it with another single quote
for *condor_submit* parsing as in the example's NodeA ``fourth`` macro.

As an example that shows uses of all special characters, here are only
the relevant parts of a DAG input file. Note that the NodeA value for
the macro ``second`` contains a tab.

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    VARS NodeA first="Alberto Contador"
    VARS NodeA second="\"\"Andy Schleck\"\""
    VARS NodeA third="Lance\\ Armstrong"
    VARS NodeA fourth="Vincenzo ''The Shark'' Nibali"
    VARS NodeA misc="!@#$%^&*()_-=+=[]{}?/"

    VARS NodeB first="Lance_Armstrong"
    VARS NodeB second="\\\"Andreas_Kloden\\\""
    VARS NodeB third="Ivan_Basso"
    VARS NodeB fourth="Bernard_'The_Badger'_Hinault"
    VARS NodeB misc="!@#$%^&*()_-=+=[]{}?/"

    VARS NodeC args="'Nairo Quintana' 'Chris Froome'"

Consider an example in which the submit description file for NodeA uses
the New Syntax for the **arguments** command:

.. code-block:: condor-submit

    arguments = "'$(first)' '$(second)' '$(third)' '($fourth)' '$(misc)'"

The single quotes around each variable reference are only necessary if
the variable value may contain spaces or tabs. The resulting values
passed to the NodeA executable are:

.. code-block:: text

    Alberto Contador
    "Andy Schleck"
    Lance\ Armstrong
    Vincenzo 'The Shark' Nibali
    !@#$%^&*()_-=+=[]{}?/

Consider an example in which the submit description file for NodeB uses
the Old Syntax for the **arguments** command:

.. code-block:: condor-submit

      arguments = $(first) $(second) $(third) $(fourth) $(misc)

The resulting values passed to the NodeB executable are:

.. code-block:: text

      Lance_Armstrong
      "Andreas_Kloden"
      Ivan_Basso
      Bernard_'The_Badger'_Hinault
      !@#$%^&*()_-=+=[]{}?/

Consider an example in which the submit description file for NodeC uses
the New Syntax for the **arguments** command:

.. code-block:: condor-submit

      arguments = "$(args)"

The resulting values passed to the NodeC executable are:

.. code-block:: text

      Nairo Quintana
      Chris Froome

Using special macros within a definition
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The $(JOB) and $(RETRY) macros may be used within a definition of the
*string* that defines a variable. This usage requires parentheses, such
that proper macro substitution may take place when the macro's value is
only a portion of the string.

-  $(JOB) expands to the node *JobName*. If the *VARS* line appears in a
   DAG file used as a splice file, then $(JOB) will be the fully scoped
   name of the node.

   For example, the DAG input file lines

   .. code-block:: condor-dagman

         JOB  NodeC NodeC.submit
         VARS NodeC nodename="$(JOB)"

   set ``nodename`` to ``NodeC``, and the DAG input file lines

   .. code-block:: condor-dagman

         JOB  NodeD NodeD.submit
         VARS NodeD outfilename="$(JOB)-output"

   set ``outfilename`` to ``NodeD-output``.

-  $(RETRY) expands to 0 the first time a node is run; the value is
   incremented each time the node is retried. For example:

   .. code-block:: condor-dagman

         VARS NodeE noderetry="$(RETRY)"

Using VARS to define ClassAd attributes
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The *macroname* may also begin with a ``+`` character, in which case it
names a ClassAd attribute. For example, the VARS specification

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    VARS NodeF +A="\"bob\""

results in the job ClassAd attribute

.. code-block:: condor-classad

    A = "bob"

Note that ClassAd string values must be quoted, hence there are escaped
quotes in the example above. The outer quotes are consumed in the
parsing of the DAG input file, so the escaped inner quotes remain in the
definition of the attribute value.

Continuing this example, it allows the HTCondor submit description file
for NodeF to use the following line:

.. code-block:: condor-submit

    arguments = "$$([A])"

The special macros may also be used. For example

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    VARS NodeG +B="$(RETRY)"

places the numerical attribute

.. code-block:: condor-classad

    B = 1

into the ClassAd when the NodeG job is run for a second time, which is
the first retry and the value 1.

Setting Priorities for Nodes
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

:index:`PRIORITY command<single: PRIORITY command; DAG input file>`
:index:`node priorities<single: node priorities; DAGMan>`

The *PRIORITY* command assigns a priority to a DAG node (and to the
HTCondor job(s) associated with the node). The syntax for *PRIORITY* is

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    PRIORITY <JobName | ALL_NODES> PriorityValue

The priority value is an integer (which can be negative). A larger
numerical priority is better. The default priority is 0.

The node priority affects the order in which nodes that are ready (all
of their parent nodes have finished successfully) at the same time will
be submitted. The node priority also sets the node job's priority in the
queue (that is, its ``JobPrio`` attribute), which affects the order in
which jobs will be run once they are submitted (see
:ref:`users-manual/priorities-and-preemption:job priority` for more
information). The node priority only affects the
order of job submission within a given DAG; but once jobs are submitted,
their ``JobPrio`` value affects the order in which they will be run
relative to all jobs submitted by the same user.

Sub-DAGs can have priorities, just as "regular" nodes can. (The priority
of a sub-DAG will affect the priorities of its nodes: see "effective
node priorities" below.) Splices cannot be assigned a priority, but
individual nodes within a splice can be assigned priorities.

Note that node priority does not override the DAG dependencies. Also
note that node priorities are not guarantees of the relative order in
which nodes will be run, even among nodes that become ready at the same
time - so node priorities should not be used as a substitute for
parent/child dependencies. In other words, priorities should be used
when it is preferable, but not required, that some jobs run before
others. (The order in which jobs are run once they are submitted can be
affected by many things other than the job's priority; for example,
whether there are machines available in the pool that match the job's
requirements.)

PRE scripts can affect the order in which jobs run, so DAGs containing
PRE scripts may not submit the nodes in exact priority order, even if
doing so would satisfy the DAG dependencies.

Node priority is most relevant if node submission is throttled (via the
*-maxjobs* or *-maxidle* command-line arguments or the
``DAGMAN_MAX_JOBS_SUBMITTED`` or ``DAGMAN_MAX_JOBS_IDLE`` configuration
variables), or if there are not enough resources in the pool to
immediately run all submitted node jobs. This is often the case for DAGs
with large numbers of "sibling" nodes, or DAGs running on heavily-loaded
pools.

**Example**

Adding *PRIORITY* for node C in the diamond-shaped DAG:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File name: diamond.dag

    JOB  A  A.condor
    JOB  B  B.condor
    JOB  C  C.condor
    JOB  D  D.condor
    PARENT A CHILD B C
    PARENT B C CHILD D
    RETRY  C 3
    PRIORITY C 1

This will cause node C to be submitted (and, mostly likely, run) before
node B. Without this priority setting for node C, node B would be
submitted first because the "JOB" statement for node B comes earlier in
the DAG file than the "JOB" statement for node C.

Effective node priorities
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

**The "effective" priority for a node (the priority controlling the order
in which nodes are actually submitted, and which is assigned to JobPrio)
is the sum of the explicit priority (specified in the DAG file) and the
priority of the DAG itself.** DAG priorities also default to 0, so they
are most relevant for sub-DAGs (although a top-level DAG can be submitted
with a non-zero priority by specifying a **-priority** value on the
*condor_submit_dag* command line). **This algorithm for calculating
effective priorities is a simplification introduced in version 8.5.7 (a
node's effective priority is no longer dependent on the priorities of
its parents).**

Here is an example to clarify:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File name: priorities.dag

    JOB A A.sub
    SUBDAG EXTERNAL B SD.dag
    PARENT A CHILD B
    PRIORITY A 60
    PRIORITY B 100

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File name: SD.dag

    JOB SA SA.sub
    JOB SB SB.sub
    PARENT SA CHILD SB
    PRIORITY SA 10
    PRIORITY SB 20

In this example (assuming that priorities.dag is submitted with the
default priority of 0), the effective priority of node A will be 60, and
the effective priority of sub-DAG B will be 100. Therefore, the
effective priority of node SA will be 110 and the effective priority of
node SB will be 120.

The effective priorities listed above are assigned by DAGMan. There is
no way to change the priority in the submit description file for a job,
as DAGMan will override any
**priority** :index:`priority<single: priority; submit commands>` command placed
in a submit description file (unless the effective node priority is 0;
in this case, any priority specified in the submit file will take
effect).

Throttling Nodes by Category
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

:index:`CATEGORY command<single: CATEGORY command; DAG input file>`
:index:`MAXJOBS command<single: MAXJOBS command; DAG input file>`
:index:`throttling nodes by category<single: throttling nodes by category; DAGMan>`

In order to limit the number of submitted job clusters within a DAG, the
nodes may be placed into categories by assignment of a name. Then, a
maximum number of submitted clusters may be specified for each category.

The *CATEGORY* command assigns a category name to a DAG node. The syntax
for *CATEGORY* is

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    CATEGORY <JobName | ALL_NODES> CategoryName

Category names cannot contain white space.

The *MAXJOBS* command limits the number of submitted job clusters on a
per category basis. The syntax for *MAXJOBS* is

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    MAXJOBS CategoryName MaxJobsValue

If the number of submitted job clusters for a given category reaches the
limit, no further job clusters in that category will be submitted until
other job clusters within the category terminate. If MAXJOBS is not set
for a defined category, then there is no limit placed on the number of
submissions within that category.

Note that a single invocation of *condor_submit* results in one job
cluster. The number of HTCondor jobs within a cluster may be greater
than 1.

The configuration variable ``DAGMAN_MAX_JOBS_SUBMITTED`` and the
*condor_submit_dag* *-maxjobs* command-line option are still enforced
if these *CATEGORY* and *MAXJOBS* throttles are used.

Please see the end of :ref:`users-manual/dagman-workflows:advanced features
of dagman` on DAG Splicing for a description of the interaction between
categories and splices.

Configuration Specific to a DAG
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

:index:`CONFIG command<single: CONFIG command; DAG input file>`
:index:`configuration specific to a DAG<single: configuration specific to a DAG; DAGMan>`

All configuration variables and their definitions that relate to DAGMan
may be found in
ref:`admin-manual/configuration-macros:configuration file entries for dagman`.

Configuration variables for *condor_dagman* can be specified in several
ways, as given within the ordered list:

#. In an HTCondor configuration file.
#. With an environment variable. Prepend the string _CONDOR_ to the
   configuration variable's name.
#. With a line in the DAG input file using the keyword *CONFIG*, such
   that there is a configuration file specified that is specific to an
   instance of *condor_dagman*. The configuration file specification
   may instead be specified on the *condor_submit_dag* command line
   using the **-config** option.
#. For some configuration variables, *condor_submit_dag* command line
   argument specifies a configuration variable. For example, the
   configuration variable ``DAGMAN_MAX_JOBS_SUBMITTED`` has the
   corresponding command line argument *-maxjobs*.

For this ordered list, configuration values specified or parsed later in
the list override ones specified earlier. For example, a value specified
on the *condor_submit_dag* command line overrides corresponding values
in any configuration file. And, a value specified in a DAGMan-specific
configuration file overrides values specified in a general HTCondor
configuration file.

The *CONFIG* command within the DAG input file specifies a configuration
file to be used to set configuration variables related to
*condor_dagman* when running this DAG. The syntax for *CONFIG* is

**CONFIG** *ConfigFileName*

As an example, if the DAG input file contains:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    CONFIG dagman.config

then the configuration values in file ``dagman.config`` will be used for
this DAG. If the contents of file ``dagman.config`` is

.. code-block:: text

    DAGMAN_MAX_JOBS_IDLE = 10

then this configuration is defined for this DAG.

Only a single configuration file can be specified for a given
*condor_dagman* run. For example, if one file is specified within a DAG
input file, and a different file is specified on the
*condor_submit_dag* command line, this is a fatal error at submit
time. The same is true if different configuration files are specified in
multiple DAG input files and referenced in a single
*condor_submit_dag* command.

If multiple DAGs are run in a single *condor_dagman* run, the
configuration options specified in the *condor_dagman* configuration
file, if any, apply to all DAGs, even if some of the DAGs specify no
configuration file.

Configuration variables that are not for *condor_dagman* and not
utilized by DaemonCore, yet are specified in a *condor_dagman*-specific
configuration file are ignored.

Setting ClassAd attributes in the DAG file
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

:index:`SET_JOB_ATTR command<single: SET_JOB_ATTR command; DAG input file>`
:index:`setting ClassAd attributes in a DAG<single: setting ClassAd attributes in a DAG; DAGMan>`

The *SET_JOB_ATTR* keyword within the DAG input file specifies an
attribute/value pair to be set in the DAGMan job's ClassAd. The syntax
for *SET_JOB_ATTR* is

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    SET_JOB_ATTR AttributeName = AttributeValue

As an example, if the DAG input file contains:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    SET_JOB_ATTR TestNumber = 17

the ClassAd of the DAGMan job itself will have an attribute
``TestNumber`` with the value ``17``.

The attribute set by the *SET_JOB_ATTR* command is set only in the
ClassAd of the DAGMan job itself - it is not propagated to node jobs of
the DAG.

Values with spaces can be set by surrounding the string containing a
space with single or double quotes. (Note that the quote marks
themselves will be part of the value.)

Only a single attribute/value pair can be specified per *SET_JOB_ATTR*
command. If the same attribute is specified multiple times in the DAG
(or in multiple DAGs run by the same DAGMan instance) the last-specified
value is the one that will be utilized. An attribute set in the DAG file
can be overridden by specifying

.. code-block:: text

    -append '+<attribute> = <value>'

on the *condor_submit_dag* command line.

Optimization of Submission Time
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

:index:`optimization of submit time<single: optimization of submit time; DAGMan>`

*condor_dagman* works by watching log files for events, such as
submission, termination, and going on hold. When a new job is ready to
be run, it is submitted to the *condor_schedd*, which needs to acquire
a computing resource. Acquisition requires the *condor_schedd* to
contact the central manager and get a claim on a machine, and this claim
cycle can take many minutes.

Configuration variable ``DAGMAN_HOLD_CLAIM_TIME``
:index:`DAGMAN_HOLD_CLAIM_TIME` avoids the wait for a negotiation
cycle. When set to a non zero value, the *condor_schedd* keeps a claim
idle, such that the *condor_startd* delays in shifting from the Claimed
to the Preempting state (see :doc:`/admin-manual/policy-configuration`).
Thus, if another job appears that is suitable for the claimed resource,
then the *condor_schedd* will submit the job directly to the
*condor_startd*, avoiding the wait and overhead of a negotiation cycle.
This results in a speed up of job completion, especially for linear DAGs
in pools that have lengthy negotiation cycle times.

By default, ``DAGMAN_HOLD_CLAIM_TIME`` is 20, causing a claim to remain
idle for 20 seconds, during which time a new job can be submitted
directly to the already-claimed *condor_startd*. A value of 0 means
that claims are not held idle for a running DAG. If a DAG node has no
children, the value of ``DAGMAN_HOLD_CLAIM_TIME`` will be ignored; the
``KeepClaimIdle`` attribute will not be defined in the job ClassAd of
the node job, unless the job requests it using the submit command
**keep_claim_idle** :index:`keep_claim_idle<single: keep_claim_idle; submit commands>`.

Single Submission of Multiple, Independent DAGs
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

:index:`single submission of multiple, independent DAGs<single: single submission of multiple, independent DAGs; DAGMan>`

A single use of *condor_submit_dag* may execute multiple, independent
DAGs. Each independent DAG has its own, distinct DAG input file. These
DAG input files are command-line arguments to *condor_submit_dag*.

Internally, all of the independent DAGs are combined into a single,
larger DAG, with no dependencies between the original independent DAGs.
As a result, any generated Rescue DAG file represents all of the
original independent DAGs with a single DAG. The file name of this
Rescue DAG is based on the DAG input file listed first within the
command-line arguments. For example, assume that three independent DAGs
are submitted with

.. code-block:: console

      $ condor_submit_dag A.dag B.dag C.dag

The first listed is ``A.dag``. The remainder of the specialized file
name adds a suffix onto this first DAG input file name, ``A.dag``. The
suffix is ``_multi.rescue<XXX>``, where ``<XXX>`` is substituted by the
3-digit number of the Rescue DAG created as defined in
:ref:`users-manual/dagman-workflows:the rescue dag` section. The first
time a Rescue DAG is created for the example, it will have the file name
``A.dag_multi.rescue001``.

Other files such as ``dagman.out`` and the lock file also have names
based on this first DAG input file.

The success or failure of the independent DAGs is well defined. When
multiple, independent DAGs are submitted with a single command, the
success of the composite DAG is defined as the logical AND of the
success of each independent DAG. This implies that failure is defined as
the logical OR of the failure of any of the independent DAGs.

By default, DAGMan internally renames the nodes to avoid node name
collisions. If all node names are unique, the renaming of nodes may be
disabled by setting the configuration variable
``DAGMAN_MUNGE_NODE_NAMES`` :index:`DAGMAN_MUNGE_NODE_NAMES` to
``False`` (see ref:`admin-manual/configuration-macros:configuration file
entries for dagman`).

INCLUDE
'''''''

:index:`INCLUDE command<single: INCLUDE command; DAG input file>`
:index:`DAG INCLUDE command<single: DAG INCLUDE command; DAGMan>`

The *INCLUDE* command allows the contents of one DAG file to be parsed
as if they were physically included in the referencing DAG file. The
syntax for *INCLUDE* is

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    INCLUDE FileName

For example, if we have two DAG files like this:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File name: foo.dag

    JOB  A  A.sub
    INCLUDE bar.dag

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File name: bar.dag

    JOB  B  B.sub
    JOB  C  C.sub

this is equivalent to the single DAG file:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    JOB  A  A.sub
    JOB  B  B.sub
    JOB  C  C.sub

Note that the included file must be in proper DAG syntax. Also, there
are many cases where a valid included DAG file will cause a parse error,
such as the including and included files defining nodes with the same
name.

*INCLUDE* s can be nested to any depth (be sure not to create a cycle
of includes!).

Example: Using INCLUDE to simplify multiple similar workflows
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

One use of the *INCLUDE* command is to simplify the DAG files when we
have a single workflow that we want to run on a number of data sets. In
that case, we can do something like this:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File name: workflow.dag
    # Defines the structure of the workflow

    JOB Split split.sub
    JOB Process00 process.sub
    ...
    JOB Process99 process.sub
    JOB Combine combine.sub
    PARENT Split CHILD Process00 ... Process99
    PARENT Process00 ... Process99 CHILD Combine

.. code-block:: condor-submit

    # File name: split.sub

    executable = my_split
    input = $(dataset).phase1
    output = $(dataset).phase2
    ...

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File name: data57.vars

    VARS Split dataset="data57"
    VARS Process00 dataset="data57"
    ...
    VARS Process99 dataset="data57"
    VARS Combine dataset="data57"

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File name: run_dataset57.dag

    INCLUDE workflow.dag
    INCLUDE data57.vars

Then, to run our workflow on dataset 57, we run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ condor_submit_dag run_dataset57.dag

This avoids having to duplicate the *JOB* and *PARENT/CHILD* commands
for every dataset - we can just re-use the ``workflow.dag`` file, in
combination with a dataset-specific vars file.

Composing workflows from multiple DAG files
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

:index:`Composing workflows<single: Composing workflows; DAG input file>`
:index:`Composing workflows<single: Composing workflows; DAGMan>`

The organization and dependencies of the jobs within a DAG are the keys
to its utility. Some workflows are naturally constructed hierarchically,
such that a node within a DAG is also a DAG (instead of a "simple"
HTCondor job). HTCondor DAGMan handles this situation easily, and allows
DAGs to be nested to any depth.

There are two ways that DAGs can be nested within other DAGs: sub-DAGs
and splices (see :ref:`users-manual/dagman-workflows:advanced features
of dagman`)

With sub-DAGs, each DAG has its own *condor_dagman* job, which then
becomes a node job within the higher-level DAG. With splices, on the
other hand, the nodes of the spliced DAG are directly incorporated into
the higher-level DAG. Therefore, splices do not result in additional
*condor_dagman* instances.

A weakness in scalability exists when submitting external sub-DAGs,
because each executing independent DAG requires its own instance of
*condor_dagman* to be running. The outer DAG has an instance of
*condor_dagman*, and each named SUBDAG has an instance of
*condor_dagman* while it is in the HTCondor queue. The scaling issue
presents itself when a workflow contains hundreds or thousands of
sub-DAGs that are queued at the same time. (In this case, the resources
(especially memory) consumed by the multiple *condor_dagman* instances
can be a problem.) Further, there may be many Rescue DAGs created if a
problem occurs. (Note that the scaling issue depends only on how many
sub-DAGs are queued at any given time, not the total number of sub-DAGs
in a given workflow; division of a large workflow into sequential
sub-DAGs can actually enhance scalability.) To alleviate these concerns,
the DAGMan language introduces the concept of graph splicing.

Because splices are simpler in some ways than sub-DAGs, they are
generally preferred unless certain features are needed that are only
available with sub-DAGs. This document:
`https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/wiki?p=SubDagsVsSplices <https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/wiki?p=SubDagsVsSplices>`_
explains the pros and cons of splices and external sub-DAGs, and should
help users decide which alternative is better for their application.

Note that sub-DAGs and splices can be combined in a single workflow, and
can be nested to any depth (but be sure to avoid recursion, which will
cause problems!).

.. _subdag-external:

A DAG Within a DAG Is a SUBDAG
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

:index:`SUBDAG command<single: SUBDAG command; DAG input file>`
:index:`DAGs within DAGs<single: DAGs within DAGs; DAGMan>`

As stated above, the SUBDAG EXTERNAL command causes the specified DAG
file to be run by a separate instance of *condor_dagman*, with the
*condor_dagman* job becoming a node job within the higher-level DAG.

The syntax for the SUBDAG command is

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    SUBDAG EXTERNAL JobName DagFileName [DIR directory] [NOOP] [DONE]

The optional specifications of **DIR**, **NOOP**, and **DONE**, if used,
must appear in this order within the entry. **NOOP** and **DONE** for
**SUBDAG** nodes have the same effect that they do for **JOB** nodes.

A **SUBDAG** node is essentially the same as any other node, except that
the DAG input file for the inner DAG is specified, instead of the
HTCondor submit file. The keyword **EXTERNAL** means that the SUBDAG is
run within its own instance of *condor_dagman*.

Since more than one DAG is being discussed, here is terminology
introduced to clarify which DAG is which. Reuse the example
diamond-shaped DAG as given in the following description. Assume
that node B of this diamond-shaped DAG will itself be a DAG. The DAG of
node B is called a SUBDAG, inner DAG, or lower-level DAG. The
diamond-shaped DAG is called the outer or top-level DAG.

Work on the inner DAG first. Here is a very simple linear DAG input file
used as an example of the inner DAG.

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File name: inner.dag

    JOB  X  X.submit
    JOB  Y  Y.submit
    JOB  Z  Z.submit
    PARENT X CHILD Y
    PARENT Y CHILD Z

The HTCondor submit description file, used by *condor_dagman*,
corresponding to ``inner.dag`` will be named ``inner.dag.condor.sub``.
The DAGMan submit description file is always named
``<DAG file name>.condor.sub``. Each DAG or SUBDAG results in the
submission of *condor_dagman* as an HTCondor job, and
*condor_submit_dag* creates this submit description file.

The preferred specification of the DAG input file for the outer DAG is

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File name: diamond.dag

    JOB  A  A.submit
    SUBDAG EXTERNAL  B  inner.dag
    JOB  C  C.submit
    JOB  D  D.submit
    PARENT A CHILD B C
    PARENT B C CHILD D

Within the outer DAG's input file, the **SUBDAG** command specifies a
special case of a **JOB** node, where the job is itself a DAG.

One of the benefits of using the SUBDAG feature is that portions of the
overall workflow can be constructed and modified during the execution of
the DAG (a SUBDAG file doesn't have to exist until just before it is
submitted). A drawback can be that each SUBDAG causes its own distinct
job submission of *condor_dagman*, leading to a larger number of jobs,
together with their potential need of carefully constructed policy
configuration to throttle node submission or execution (because each
SUBDAG has its own throttles).

Here are details that affect SUBDAGs:

-  Nested DAG Submit Description File Generation

   There are three ways to generate the ``<DAG file name>.condor.sub``
   file of a SUBDAG:

   -  **Lazily** (the default in HTCondor version 7.5.2 and later
      versions)
   -  **Eagerly** (the default in HTCondor versions 7.4.1 through 7.5.1)
   -  **Manually** (the only way prior to version HTCondor version
      7.4.1)

   When the ``<DAG file name>.condor.sub`` file is generated **lazily**,
   this file is generated immediately before the SUBDAG job is
   submitted. Generation is accomplished by running

   .. code-block:: console

        $ condor_submit_dag -no_submit

   on the DAG input file specified in the **SUBDAG** entry. This is the
   default behavior. There are advantages to this lazy mode of submit
   description file creation for the SUBDAG:

   -  The DAG input file for a SUBDAG does not have to exist until the
      SUBDAG is ready to run, so this file can be dynamically created by
      earlier parts of the outer DAG or by the PRE script of the node
      containing the SUBDAG.
   -  It is now possible to have SUBDAGs within splices. That is not
      possible with eager submit description file creation, because
      *condor_submit_dag* does not understand splices.

   The main disadvantage of lazy submit file generation is that a syntax
   error in the DAG input file of a SUBDAG will not be discovered until
   the outer DAG tries to run the inner DAG.

   When ``<DAG file name>.condor.sub`` files are generated **eagerly**,
   *condor_submit_dag* runs itself recursively (with the *-no_submit*
   option) on each SUBDAG, so all of the ``<DAG file name>.condor.sub``
   files are generated before the top-level DAG is actually submitted.
   To generate the ``<DAG file      name>.condor.sub`` files eagerly,
   pass the *-do_recurse* flag to *condor_submit_dag*; also set the
   ``DAGMAN_GENERATE_SUBDAG_SUBMITS`` configuration variable to
   ``False``, so that *condor_dagman* does not re-run
   *condor_submit_dag* at run time thereby regenerating the submit
   description files.

   To generate the ``.condor.sub`` files **manually**, run

   .. code-block:: console

       $ condor_submit_dag -no_submit

   on each lower-level DAG file, before running *condor_submit_dag* on
   the top-level DAG file; also set the
   ``DAGMAN_GENERATE_SUBDAG_SUBMITS`` configuration variable to
   ``False``, so that *condor_dagman* does not re-run
   *condor_submit_dag* at run time. The main reason for generating the
   ``<DAG file name>.condor.sub`` files manually is to set options for
   the lower-level DAG that one would not otherwise be able to set An
   example of this is the *-insert_sub_file* option. For instance,
   using the given example do the following to manually generate
   HTCondor submit description files:

   .. code-block:: console

         $ condor_submit_dag -no_submit -insert_sub_file fragment.sub inner.dag
         $ condor_submit_dag diamond.dag

   Note that most *condor_submit_dag* command-line flags have
   corresponding configuration variables, so we encourage the use of
   per-DAG configuration files, especially in the case of nested DAGs.
   This is the easiest way to set different options for different DAGs
   in an overall workflow.

   It is possible to combine more than one method of generating the
   ``<DAG file name>.condor.sub`` files. For example, one might pass the
   *-do_recurse* flag to *condor_submit_dag*, but leave the
   ``DAGMAN_GENERATE_SUBDAG_SUBMITS`` configuration variable set to the
   default of ``True``. Doing this would provide the benefit of an
   immediate error message at submit time, if there is a syntax error in
   one of the inner DAG input files, but the lower-level
   ``<DAG file name>.condor.sub`` files would still be regenerated
   before each nested DAG is submitted.

   The values of the following command-line flags are passed from the
   top-level *condor_submit_dag* instance to any lower-level
   *condor_submit_dag* instances. This occurs whether the lower-level
   submit description files are generated lazily or eagerly:

   -  **-verbose**
   -  **-force**
   -  **-notification**
   -  **-allowlogerror**
   -  **-dagman**
   -  **-usedagdir**
   -  **-outfile_dir**
   -  **-oldrescue**
   -  **-autorescue**
   -  **-dorescuefrom**
   -  **-allowversionmismatch**
   -  **-no_recurse/do_recurse**
   -  **-update_submit**
   -  **-import_env**
   -  **-suppress_notification**
   -  **-priority**
   -  **-dont_use_default_node_log**

   The values of the following command-line flags are preserved in any
   already-existing lower-level DAG submit description files:

   -  **-maxjobs**
   -  **-maxidle**
   -  **-maxpre**
   -  **-maxpost**
   -  **-debug**

   Other command-line arguments are set to their defaults in any
   lower-level invocations of *condor_submit_dag*.

   The **-force** option will cause existing DAG submit description
   files to be overwritten without preserving any existing values.

-  Submission of the outer DAG

   The outer DAG is submitted as before, with the command

   .. code-block:: console

        $ condor_submit_dag diamond.dag

-  Interaction with Rescue DAGs

   The use of new-style Rescue DAGs is now the default. With new-style
   rescue DAGs, the appropriate rescue DAG(s) will be run automatically
   if there is a failure somewhere in the workflow. For example (given
   the DAGs in the example at the beginning of the SUBDAG section), if
   one of the nodes in ``inner.dag`` fails, this will produce a Rescue
   DAG for ``inner.dag`` (named ``inner.dag.rescue.001``). Then, since
   ``inner.dag`` failed, node B of ``diamond.dag`` will fail, producing
   a Rescue DAG for ``diamond.dag`` (named ``diamond.dag.rescue.001``,
   etc.). If the command

   .. code-block:: console

        $ condor_submit_dag diamond.dag

   is re-run, the most recent outer Rescue DAG will be run, and this
   will re-run the inner DAG, which will in turn run the most recent
   inner Rescue DAG.

-  File Paths

   Remember that, unless the DIR keyword is used in the outer DAG, the
   inner DAG utilizes the current working directory when the outer DAG
   is submitted. Therefore, all paths utilized by the inner DAG file
   must be specified accordingly.

DAG Splicing
''''''''''''

:index:`SPLICE command<single: SPLICE command; DAG input file>`
:index:`splicing DAGs<single: splicing DAGs; DAGMan>`

As stated above, the SPLICE command causes the nodes of the spliced DAG
to be directly incorporated into the higher-level DAG (the DAG
containing the SPLICE command).

The syntax for the *SPLICE* command is

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    SPLICE SpliceName DagFileName [DIR directory]

A splice is a named instance of a subgraph which is specified in a
separate DAG file. The splice is treated as an entity for dependency
specification in the including DAG. (Conceptually, a splice is treated
as a node within the DAG containing the SPLICE command, although there
are some limitations, which are discussed below. This means, for
example, that splices can have parents and children.) A splice can also
be incorporated into an including DAG without any dependencies; it is
then considered a disjoint DAG within the including DAG.

The same DAG file can be reused as differently named splices, each one
incorporating a copy of the dependency graph (and nodes therein) into
the including DAG.

The nodes within a splice are scoped according to a hierarchy of names
associated with the splices, as the splices are parsed from the top
level DAG file. The scoping character to describe the inclusion
hierarchy of nodes into the top level dag is '+'. (In other words, if a
splice named "SpliceX" contains a node named "NodeY", the full node name
once the DAGs are parsed is "SpliceX+NodeY". This character is chosen
due to a restriction in the allowable characters which may be in a file
name across the variety of platforms that HTCondor supports. In any DAG
input file, all splices must have unique names, but the same splice name
may be reused in different DAG input files.

HTCondor does not detect nor support splices that form a cycle within
the DAG. A DAGMan job that causes a cyclic inclusion of splices will
eventually exhaust available memory and crash.

The *SPLICE* command in a DAG input file creates a named instance of a
DAG as specified in another file as an entity which may have *PARENT*
and *CHILD* dependencies associated with other splice names or node
names in the including DAG file.

The following series of examples illustrate potential uses of splicing.
To simplify the examples, presume that each and every job uses the same,
simple HTCondor submit description file:

.. code-block:: condor-submit

      # BEGIN SUBMIT FILE submit.condor
      executable   = /bin/echo
      arguments    = OK
      universe     = vanilla
      output       = $(jobname).out
      error        = $(jobname).err
      log          = submit.log
      notification = NEVER
      queue
      # END SUBMIT FILE submit.condor

This first simple example splices a diamond-shaped DAG in between the
two nodes of a top level DAG. Here is the DAG input file for the
diamond-shaped DAG:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

      # BEGIN DAG FILE diamond.dag
      JOB A submit.condor
      VARS A jobname="$(JOB)"

      JOB B submit.condor
      VARS B jobname="$(JOB)"

      JOB C submit.condor
      VARS C jobname="$(JOB)"

      JOB D submit.condor
      VARS D jobname="$(JOB)"

      PARENT A CHILD B C
      PARENT B C CHILD D
      # END DAG FILE diamond.dag

The top level DAG incorporates the diamond-shaped splice:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

      # BEGIN DAG FILE toplevel.dag
      JOB X submit.condor
      VARS X jobname="$(JOB)"

      JOB Y submit.condor
      VARS Y jobname="$(JOB)"

      # This is an instance of diamond.dag, given the symbolic name DIAMOND
      SPLICE DIAMOND diamond.dag

      # Set up a relationship between the nodes in this dag and the splice

      PARENT X CHILD DIAMOND
      PARENT DIAMOND CHILD Y

      # END DAG FILE toplevel.dag

The following example illustrates the resulting top level DAG
and the dependencies produced. Notice the naming of nodes scoped with
the splice name. This hierarchy of splice names assures unique names
associated with all nodes.

  :width: 350
  :alt: The diamond-shaped DAG spliced between two nodes.
  :align: center

  The diamond-shaped DAG spliced between two nodes.

The next example illustrates the starting point for a
more complex example. The DAG input file ``X.dag`` describes this
X-shaped DAG. The completed example displays more of the spatial
constructs provided by splices. Pay particular attention to the notion
that each named splice creates a new graph, even when the same DAG input
file is specified.

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

      # BEGIN DAG FILE X.dag

      JOB A submit.condor
      VARS A jobname="$(JOB)"

      JOB B submit.condor
      VARS B jobname="$(JOB)"

      JOB C submit.condor
      VARS C jobname="$(JOB)"

      JOB D submit.condor
      VARS D jobname="$(JOB)"

      JOB E submit.condor

File ``s1.dag`` continues the example, presenting the DAG input file
that incorporates two separate splices of the X-shaped DAG.
The next description illustrates the resulting DAG.

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

      # BEGIN DAG FILE s1.dag

      JOB A submit.condor
      VARS A jobname="$(JOB)"

      JOB B submit.condor
      VARS B jobname="$(JOB)"

      # name two individual splices of the X-shaped DAG
      SPLICE X1 X.dag
      SPLICE X2 X.dag

      # Define dependencies
      # A must complete before the initial nodes in X1 can start
      PARENT A CHILD X1
      # All final nodes in X1 must finish before
      # the initial nodes in X2 can begin
      PARENT X1 CHILD X2
      # All final nodes in X2 must finish before B may begin.
      PARENT X2 CHILD B

The top level DAG in the hierarchy of this complex example is described
by the DAG input file ``toplevel.dag``, which illustrates the final DAG. 
Notice that the DAG has two disjoint graphs in it as a result of splice S3 not
having any dependencies associated with it in this top level DAG.

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

      # BEGIN DAG FILE toplevel.dag

      JOB A submit.condor
      VARS A jobname="$(JOB)"

      # the diamond dag finishes
      SPLICE S2 X.dag
      PARENT D CHILD S2

Splices and rescue DAGs
'''''''''''''''''''''''

Because the nodes of a splice are directly incorporated into the DAG
containing the SPLICE command, splices do not generate their own rescue
DAGs, unlike SUBDAG EXTERNALs.

**The DIR option with splices**

The *DIR* option specifies a working directory for a splice, from which
the splice will be parsed and the jobs within the splice submitted. The
directory associated with the splice's *DIR* specification will be
propagated as a prefix to all nodes in the splice and any included
splices. If a node already has a *DIR* specification, then the splice's
*DIR* specification will be a prefix to the node's, separated by a
directory separator character. Jobs in included splices with an absolute
path for their *DIR* specification will have their *DIR* specification
untouched. Note that a DAG containing *DIR* specifications cannot be run
in conjunction with the *-usedagdir* command-line argument to
*condor_submit_dag*.

A "full" rescue DAG generated by a DAG run with the *-usedagdir*
argument will contain DIR specifications, so such a rescue DAG must be
run without the *-usedagdir* argument. (Note that "full" rescue DAGs are
no longer the default.)

**Limitation: splice DAGs must exist at submit time**

Unlike the DAG files referenced in a SUBDAG EXTERNAL command, DAG files
referenced in a SPLICE command must exist when the DAG containing the
SPLICE command is submitted. (Note that, if a SPLICE is contained within
a sub-DAG, the splice DAG must exist at the time that the sub-DAG is
submitted, not when the top-most DAG is submitted, so the splice DAG can
be created by a part of the workflow that runs before the relevant
sub-DAG.)

**Limitation: Splices and PRE or POST Scripts**

A PRE or POST script may not be specified for a splice (however, nodes
within a spliced DAG can have PRE and POST scripts). (The reason for
this is that, when the DAG is parsed, the splices are also parsed and
the splice nodes are directly incorporated into the DAG containing the
SPLICE command. Therefore, once parsing is complete, there are no actual
nodes corresponding to the splice itself to which to "attach" the PRE or
POST scripts.)

To achieve the desired effect of having a PRE script associated with a
splice, introduce a new NOOP node into the DAG with the splice as a
dependency. Attach the PRE script to the NOOP node.

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # BEGIN DAG FILE example1.dag

    # Names a node with no associated node job, a NOOP node
    # Note that the file noop.submit does not need to exist
    JOB OnlyPreNode noop.submit NOOP

    # Attach a PRE script to the NOOP node
    SCRIPT PRE OnlyPreNode prescript.sh

    # Define the splice
    SPLICE TheSplice thenode.dag

    # Define the dependency
    PARENT OnlyPreNode CHILD TheSplice

    # END DAG FILE example1.dag

The same technique is used to achieve the effect of having a POST script
associated with a splice. Introduce a new NOOP node into the DAG as a
child of the splice, and attach the POST script to the NOOP node.

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # BEGIN DAG FILE example2.dag

    # Names a node with no associated node job, a NOOP node
    # Note that the file noop.submit does not need to exist.
    JOB OnlyPostNode noop.submit NOOP

    # Attach a POST script to the NOOP node
    SCRIPT POST OnlyPostNode postscript.sh

    # Define the splice
    SPLICE TheSplice thenode.dag

    # Define the dependency
    PARENT TheSplice CHILD OnlyPostNode

    # END DAG FILE example2.dag

**Limitation: Splices and the RETRY of a Node, use of VARS, or use of PRIORITY**

A RETRY, VARS or PRIORITY command cannot be specified for a SPLICE;
however, individual nodes within a spliced DAG can have a RETRY, VARS or
PRIORITY specified.

Here is an example showing a DAG that will not be parsed successfully:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

      # top level DAG input file
      JOB    A a.sub
      SPLICE B b.dag
      PARENT A  CHILD B

      # cannot work, as B is not a node in the DAG once
      # splice B is incorporated
      RETRY B 3
      VARS B dataset="10"
      PRIORITY B 20

The following example will work:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

      # top level DAG input file
      JOB    A a.sub
      SPLICE B b.dag
      PARENT A  CHILD B

      # file: b.dag
      JOB    X x.sub
      RETRY X 3
      VARS X dataset="10"
      PRIORITY X 20

When RETRY is desired on an entire subgraph of a workflow, sub-DAGs (see
above) must be used instead of splices.

Here is the same example, now defining job B as a SUBDAG, and effecting
RETRY on that SUBDAG.

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

      # top level DAG input file
      JOB    A a.sub
      SUBDAG EXTERNAL B b.dag
      PARENT A  CHILD B

      RETRY B 3

**Limitation: The Interaction of Categories and MAXJOBS with Splices**

Categories normally refer only to nodes within a given splice. All of
the assignments of nodes to a category, and the setting of the category
throttle, should be done within a single DAG file. However, it is now
possible to have categories include nodes from within more than one
splice. To do this, the category name is prefixed with the '+' (plus)
character. This tells DAGMan that the category is a cross-splice
category. Towards deeper understanding, what this really does is prevent
renaming of the category when the splice is incorporated into the
upper-level DAG. The MAXJOBS specification for the category can appear
in either the upper-level DAG file or one of the splice DAG files. It
probably makes the most sense to put it in the upper-level DAG file.

Here is an example which applies a single limitation on submitted jobs,
identifying the category with ``+init``.

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # relevant portion of file name: upper.dag

    SPLICE A splice1.dag
    SPLICE B splice2.dag

    MAXJOBS +init 2

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # relevant portion of file name: splice1.dag

    JOB C C.sub
    CATEGORY C +init
    JOB D D.sub
    CATEGORY D +init

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # relevant portion of file name: splice2.dag

    JOB X X.sub
    CATEGORY X +init
    JOB Y Y.sub
    CATEGORY Y +init

For both global and non-global category throttles, settings at a higher
level in the DAG override settings at a lower level. In this example:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # relevant portion of file name: upper.dag

    SPLICE A lower.dag

    MAXJOBS A+catX 10
    MAXJOBS +catY 2


    # relevant portion of file name: lower.dag

    MAXJOBS catX 5
    MAXJOBS +catY 1

the resulting throttle settings are 2 for the ``+catY`` category and 10
for the ``A+catX`` category in splice. Note that non-global category
names are prefixed with their splice name(s), so to refer to a
non-global category at a higher level, the splice name must be included.

DAG Splice Connections
''''''''''''''''''''''

:index:`CONNECT command<single: CONNECT command; DAG input file>`
:index:`PIN_IN command<single: PIN_IN command; DAG input file>`
:index:`PIN_OUT command<single: PIN_OUT command; DAG input file>`
:index:`connecting DAG splices<single: connecting DAG splices; DAGMan>`

In the "default" usage of splices described above, when one splice is
the parent of another splice, all "terminal" nodes (nodes with no
children) of the parent splice become parents of all "initial" nodes
(nodes with no parents) of the child splice. The CONNECT, PIN_IN, and
PIN_OUT commands (added in version 8.5.7) allow more flexible
dependencies between splices. (The terms PIN_IN and PIN_OUT were
chosen because of the hardware analogy.)

The syntax for *CONNECT* is

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    CONNECT OutputSpliceName InputSpliceName

The syntax for *PIN_IN* is

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    PIN_IN NodeName PinNumber

The syntax for *PIN_OUT* is

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    PIN_OUT NodeName PinNumber

All output splice nodes connected to a given pin_out will become
parents of all input splice nodes connected to the corresponding
pin_in. (The pin_ins and pin_outs exist only to create the correct
parent/child dependencies between nodes. Once the DAG is parsed, there
are no actual DAG objects corresponding to the pin_ins and pin_outs.)

Any given splice can contain both PIN_IN and PIN_OUT definitions, and
can be both an input and output splice in different CONNECT commands.
Furthermore, a splice can appear in any number of CONNECT commands (for
example, a given splice could be the output splice in two CONNECT
commands that have different input splices). It is not an error for a
splice to have PIN_IN or PIN_OUT definitions that are not associated
with a CONNECT command - such PIN_IN and PIN_OUT commands are simply
ignored.

Note that the pin_ins and pin_outs must be defined within the relevant
splices (this can be done with *INCLUDE* commands), not in the DAG that
connects the splices.

**There are a number of restrictions on splice connections:**

-  Connections can be made only between two splices; "regular" nodes or
   sub-DAGs cannot be used in a CONNECT command.
-  Pin_ins and pin_outs must be numbered consecutively starting at 1.
-  The pin_outs of the output splice in a connect command must match
   the pin_ins of the input splice in the command.
-  All "initial" nodes (nodes with no parents) of an input splice used
   in a CONNECT command must be connected to a pin_in.

Violating any of these restrictions will result in an error during the
parsing of the DAG files.

Note: it is probably desirable for any "terminal" node (a node with no
children) in the output splice to be connected to a pin_out - but this
is not required.

**Here is a simple example:**

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File: top.dag
    SPLICE A spliceA.dag
    SPLICE B spliceB.dag
    SPLICE C spliceC.dag

    CONNECT A B
    CONNECT B C

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File: spliceA.dag
    JOB A1 A1.sub
    JOB A2 A2.sub

    PIN_OUT A1 1
    PIN_OUT A2 2

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File: spliceB.dag
    JOB B1 B1.sub
    JOB B2 B2.sub
    JOB B3 B3.sub
    JOB B4 B4.sub

    PIN_IN B1 1
    PIN_IN B2 1
    PIN_IN B3 2
    PIN_IN B4 2

    PIN_OUT B1 1
    PIN_OUT B2 2
    PIN_OUT B3 3
    PIN_OUT B4 4

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File: spliceC.dag
    JOB C1 C1.sub

    PIN_IN C1 1
    PIN_IN C1 2
    PIN_IN C1 3
    PIN_IN C1 4

In this example, node A1 will be the parent of B1 and B2; node A2 will
be the parent of B3 and B4; and nodes B1, B2, B3 and B4 will all be
parents of C1.

PROVISIONER node
''''''''''''''''

:index:`PROVISIONER command<single: PROVISIONER command; DAG input file>`
:index:`PROVISIONER node<single: PROVISIONER node; DAGMan>`

A PROVISIONER node is a single and special node that is always run at the
beginning of a DAG. It can be used to provision resources (ie. Amazon EC2
instances, in-memory database servers) that can then be used by the remainder
of the nodes in the workflow.

The syntax used for the *PROVISIONER* command is

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    PROVISIONER JobName SubmitDescriptionFileName

When a PROVISIONER is defined in a DAG, it gets run at the beginning of the
DAG, and no other nodes are run until the PROVISIONER has advertised that it
is ready. It does this by setting the ``ProvisionerState`` attribute in its
job classad to the enumerated value ``ProvisionerState::PROVISIONING_COMPLETE``
(currently: 2). Once DAGMan sees that it is ready, it will start running
other nodes in the DAG as usual. At this point the PROVISIONER job continues
to run, typically sleeping and waiting while other nodes in the DAG use its
resources.

A PROVISIONER runs for a set amount of time defined in its job. It does not
get terminated automatically at the end of a DAG workflow. The expectation
is that it needs to explicitly deprovision any resources, such as expensive
cloud computing instances that should not be allowed to run indefinitely. 

SERVICE node
''''''''''''

:index:`SERVICE command<single: SERVICE command; DAG input file>`
:index:`SERVICE node<single: SERVICE node; DAGMan>`

A **SERVICE** node is a special type of node that is always run at the
beginning of a DAG. These are typically used to run tasks that need to run
alongside a DAGMan workflow (ie. progress monitoring) without any direct
dependencies to the other nodes in the workflow.

The syntax used for the *SERVICE* command is

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    SERVICE ServiceName SubmitDescriptionFileName

When a SERVICE is defined in a DAG, it gets started at the beginning of the
workflow. There is no guarantee that it will start running before any of the
other nodes, although running it directly from the access point using
``universe = local`` or ``universe = scheduler`` will almost always make this 
go first.

A SERVICE node runs on a **best-effort basis**. If this node fails to submit
correctly, this will not register as an error and the DAG workflow 
will continue normally.

If a DAGMan workflow finishes while there are SERVICE nodes still running,
it will shut these down and then exit the workflow successfully.

FINAL node

:index:`FINAL command<single: FINAL command; DAG input file>`
:index:`FINAL node<single: FINAL node; DAGMan>`

A FINAL node is a single and special node that is always run at the end
of the DAG, even if previous nodes in the DAG have failed. A FINAL node
can be used for tasks such as cleaning up intermediate files and
checking the output of previous nodes. The *FINAL* command in the DAG
input file specifies a node job to be run at the end of the DAG.

The syntax used for the *FINAL* command is

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    FINAL JobName SubmitDescriptionFileName [DIR directory] [NOOP]

The FINAL node within the DAG is identified by *JobName*, and the
HTCondor job is described by the contents of the HTCondor submit
description file given by *SubmitDescriptionFileName*.

The keywords *DIR* and *NOOP* are as detailed in
:ref:`users-manual/dagman-workflows:describing workflows with dagman`.
If both *DIR* and *NOOP* are used, they must appear in the order shown within
the syntax specification.

There may only be one FINAL node in a DAG. A parse error will be logged
by the *condor_dagman* job in the ``dagman.out`` file, if more than one
FINAL node is specified.

The FINAL node is virtually always run. It is run if the
*condor_dagman* job is removed with *condor_rm*. The only case in
which a FINAL node is not run is if the configuration variable
``DAGMAN_STARTUP_CYCLE_DETECT``
:index:`DAGMAN_STARTUP_CYCLE_DETECT` is set to ``True``, and a
cycle is detected at start up time. If ``DAGMAN_STARTUP_CYCLE_DETECT``
:index:`DAGMAN_STARTUP_CYCLE_DETECT` is set to ``False`` and a
cycle is detected during the course of the run, the FINAL node will be
run.

The success or failure of the FINAL node determines the success or
failure of the entire DAG, overriding the status of all previous nodes.
This includes any status specified by any ABORT-DAG-ON specification
that has taken effect. If some nodes of a DAG fail, but the FINAL node
succeeds, the DAG will be considered successful. Therefore, it is
important to be careful about setting the exit status of the FINAL node.

The ``$DAG_STATUS`` and ``$FAILED_COUNT`` macros can be used both as PRE
and POST script arguments, and in node job submit description files. As
an example of this, here are the partial contents of the DAG input file,

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

        FINAL final_node final_node.sub
        SCRIPT PRE final_node final_pre.pl $DAG_STATUS $FAILED_COUNT

and here are the partial contents of the submit description file,
``final_node.sub``

.. code-block:: condor-submit

        arguments = "$(DAG_STATUS) $(FAILED_COUNT)"

If there is a FINAL node specified for a DAG, it will be run at the end
of the workflow. If this FINAL node must not do anything in certain
cases, use the ``$DAG_STATUS`` and ``$FAILED_COUNT`` macros to take
appropriate actions. Here is an example of that behavior. It uses a PRE
script that aborts if the DAG has been removed with *condor_rm*, which,
in turn, causes the FINAL node to be considered failed without actually
submitting the HTCondor job specified for the node. Partial contents of
the DAG input file:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    FINAL final_node final_node.sub
    SCRIPT PRE final_node final_pre.pl $DAG_STATUS

and partial contents of the Perl PRE script, ``final_pre.pl``:

.. code-block:: perl

    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    if ($ARGV[0] eq 4) {
        exit(1);
    }

There are restrictions on the use of a FINAL node. The DONE option is
not allowed for a FINAL node. And, a FINAL node may not be referenced in
any of the following specifications:

-  PARENT, CHILD
-  RETRY
-  ABORT-DAG-ON
-  PRIORITY
-  CATEGORY

As of HTCondor version 8.3.7, DAGMan allows at most two submit attempts
of a FINAL node, if the DAG has been removed from the queue with
*condor_rm*.

The ALL_NODES option
'''''''''''''''''''''

:index:`ALL_NODES option<single: ALL_NODES option; DAG input file>`

In the following commands, a specific node name can be replaced by the
option *ALL_NODES*:

-  **SCRIPT**
-  **PRE_SKIP**
-  **RETRY**
-  **ABORT-DAG-ON**
-  **VARS**
-  **PRIORITY**
-  **CATEGORY**

This will cause the given command to apply to all nodes (except any
FINAL node) in that DAG.

The ALL_NODES never applies to a FINAL node. (If the *ALL_NODES*
option is used in a DAG that has a FINAL node, the ``dagman.out`` file
will contain messages noting that the FINAL node is skipped when parsing
the relevant commands.)

The *ALL_NODES* option is case-insensitive.

It is important to note that the *ALL_NODES* option does not apply
across splices and sub-DAGs. In other words, an *ALL_NODES* option
within a splice or sub-DAG will apply only to nodes within that splice
or sub-DAG; also, an *ALL_NODES* option in a parent DAG willPRIORITY DAG (again,
except any FINAL node).

As of version 8.5.8, the *ALL_NODES* option cannot be used when
multiple DAG files are specified on the *condor_submit_dag* command
line. Hopefully this limitation will be fixed in a future release.

When multiple commands (whether using the *ALL_NODES* option or not)
set a given property of a DAG node, the last relevant command overrides
earlier commands, as shown in the following examples:

For example, in this DAG:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    JOB A node.sub
    VARS A name="A"
    VARS ALL_NODES name="X"

the value of *name* for node A will be "X".

In this DAG:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    JOB A node.sub
    VARS A name="A"
    VARS ALL_NODES name="X"
    VARS A name="foo"

the value of *name* for node A will be "foo".

Here is an example DAG using the *ALL_NODES* option:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # File: all_ex.dag
    JOB A node.sub
    JOB B node.sub
    JOB C node.sub

    SCRIPT PRE ALL_NODES my_script $JOB

    VARS ALL_NODES name="$(JOB)"

    # This overrides the above VARS command for node B.
    VARS B name="nodeB"

    RETRY all_nodes 3

.. _rescue-dags:

The Rescue DAG
--------------

:index:`rescue DAG<single: rescue DAG; DAGMan>`

Any time a DAG exits unsuccessfully, DAGMan generates a Rescue DAG. The
Rescue DAG records the state of the DAG, with information such as which
nodes completed successfully, and the Rescue DAG will be used when the
DAG is again submitted. With the Rescue DAG, nodes that have already
successfully completed are not re-run.

There are a variety of circumstances under which a Rescue DAG is
generated. If a node in the DAG fails, the DAG does not exit
immediately; the remainder of the DAG is continued until no more forward
progress can be made based on the DAG's dependencies. At this point,
DAGMan produces the Rescue DAG and exits. A Rescue DAG is produced on
Unix platforms if the *condor_dagman* job itself is removed with
*condor_rm*. On Windows, a Rescue DAG is not generated in this
situation, but re-submitting the original DAG will invoke a lower-level
recovery functionality, and it will produce similar behavior to using a
Rescue DAG. A Rescue DAG is produced when a node sets and triggers an
*ABORT-DAG-ON* event with a non-zero return value. A zero return value
constitutes successful DAG completion, and therefore a Rescue DAG is not
generated.

By default, if a Rescue DAG exists, it will be used when the DAG is
submitted specifying the original DAG input file. If more than one
Rescue DAG exists, the newest one will be used. By using the Rescue DAG,
DAGMan will avoid re-running nodes that completed successfully in the
previous run. **Note that passing the -force option to condor_submit_dag
or condor_dagman will cause condor_dagman to not use any existing rescue
DAG. This means that previously-completed node jobs will be re-run.**

The granularity defining success or failure in the Rescue DAG is the
node. For a node that fails, all parts of the node will be re-run, even
if some parts were successful the first time. For example, if a node's
PRE script succeeds, but then the node's HTCondor job cluster fails, the
entire node, including the PRE script, will be re-run. A job cluster may
result in the submission of multiple HTCondor jobs. If one of the jobs
within the cluster fails, the node fails. Therefore, the Rescue DAG will
re-run the entire node, implying the submission of the entire cluster of
jobs, not just the one(s) that failed.

Statistics about the failed DAG execution are presented as comments at
the beginning of the Rescue DAG input file.

Rescue DAG Naming
'''''''''''''''''

The file name of the Rescue DAG is obtained by appending the string
.rescue<XXX> to the original DAG input file name. Values for <XXX> start
at 001 and continue to 002, 003, and beyond. The configuration variable
``DAGMAN_MAX_RESCUE_NUM`` :index:`DAGMAN_MAX_RESCUE_NUM` sets a
maximum value for <XXX>; see
:ref:`admin-manual/configuration-macros:configuration file entries for dagman`
for the complete definition of this configuration variable. If you hit the
``DAGMAN_MAX_RESCUE_NUM`` :index:`DAGMAN_MAX_RESCUE_NUM` limit,
the last Rescue DAG file is overwritten if the DAG fails again.

If a Rescue DAG exists when the original DAG is re-submitted, the Rescue
DAG with the largest magnitude value for <XXX> will be used, and its
usage is implied.

**Example**

Here is an example showing file naming and DAG submission for the case
of a failed DAG. The initial DAG is submitted with

.. code-block:: console

    $ condor_submit_dag  my.dag

A failure of this DAG results in the Rescue DAG named
``my.dag.rescue001``. The DAG is resubmitted using the same command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ condor_submit_dag  my.dag

This resubmission of the DAG uses the Rescue DAG file
``my.dag.rescue001``, because it exists. Failure of this Rescue DAG
results in another Rescue DAG called ``my.dag.rescue002``. If the DAG is
again submitted, using the same command as with the first two
submissions, but not repeated here, then this third submission uses the
Rescue DAG file ``my.dag.rescue002``, because it exists, and because the
value 002 is larger in magnitude than 001.

Backtracking to an Older Rescue DAG
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To explicitly specify a particular Rescue DAG, use the optional
command-line argument *-dorescuefrom* with *condor_submit_dag*. Note
that this will have the side effect of renaming existing Rescue DAG
files with larger magnitude values of <XXX>. Each renamed file has its
existing name appended with the string ``.old``. For example, assume
that ``my.dag`` has failed 4 times, resulting in the Rescue DAGs named
``my.dag.rescue001``, ``my.dag.rescue002``, ``my.dag.rescue003``, and
``my.dag.rescue004``. A decision is made to re-run using
``my.dag.rescue002``. The submit command is

.. code-block:: console

    $ condor_submit_dag  -dorescuefrom 2  my.dag

The DAG specified by the DAG input file ``my.dag.rescue002`` is
submitted. And, the existing Rescue DAG ``my.dag.rescue003`` is renamed
to be ``my.dag.rescue003.old``, while the existing Rescue DAG
``my.dag.rescue004`` is renamed to be ``my.dag.rescue004.old``.

Special Cases
'''''''''''''

Note that if multiple DAG input files are specified on the
*condor_submit_dag* command line, a single Rescue DAG encompassing all
of the input DAGs is generated. A DAG file containing splices also
produces a single Rescue DAG file. On the other hand, a DAG containing
sub-DAGs will produce a separate Rescue DAG for each sub-DAG that is
queued (and for the top-level DAG).

If the Rescue DAG file is generated before all retries of a node are
completed, then the Rescue DAG file will also contain *RETRY* entries.
The number of retries will be set to the appropriate remaining number of
retries. The configuration variable ``DAGMAN_RESET_RETRIES_UPON_RESCUE``
:index:`DAGMAN_RESET_RETRIES_UPON_RESCUE`
(ref:`admin-manual/configuration-macros:configuration file entries for dagman`),
controls whether or not node retries are reset in a Rescue DAG.

Partial versus Full Rescue DAGs
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

As of HTCondor version 7.7.2, the Rescue DAG file is a partial DAG file,
not a complete DAG input file as in the past.

A partial Rescue DAG file contains only information about which nodes
are done, and the number of retries remaining for nodes with retries. It
does not contain information such as the actual DAG structure and the
specification of the submit description file for each node job. Partial
Rescue DAGs are automatically parsed in combination with the original
DAG input file, which contains information about the DAG structure. This
updated implementation means that a change in the original DAG input
file, such as specifying a different submit description file for a node
job, will take effect when running the partial Rescue DAG. In other
words, you can fix mistakes in the original DAG file while still gaining
the benefit of using the Rescue DAG.

To use a partial Rescue DAG, you must re-run *condor_submit_dag* on
the original DAG file, not the Rescue DAG file.

Note that the existence of a DONE specification in a partial Rescue DAG
for a node that no longer exists in the original DAG input file is a
warning, as opposed to an error, unless the ``DAGMAN_USE_STRICT``
:index:`DAGMAN_USE_STRICT` configuration variable is set to a
value of 1 or higher (which is now the default). Comment out the line
with *DONE* in the partial Rescue DAG file to avoid a warning or error.

The previous (prior to version 7.7.2) behavior of producing full DAG
input file as the Rescue DAG is obtained by setting the configuration
variable ``DAGMAN_WRITE_PARTIAL_RESCUE``
:index:`DAGMAN_WRITE_PARTIAL_RESCUE` to the non-default value of
``False``. **Note that the option to generate full Rescue DAGs is likely
to disappear some time during the 8.3 series.**

To run a full Rescue DAG, either one left over from an older version of
DAGMan, or one produced by setting ``DAGMAN_WRITE_PARTIAL_RESCUE``
:index:`DAGMAN_WRITE_PARTIAL_RESCUE` to ``False``, directly
specify the full Rescue DAG file on the command line instead of the
original DAG file. For example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ condor_submit_dag my.dag.rescue002

Attempting to re-submit the original DAG file, if the Rescue DAG file is
a complete DAG, will result in a parse failure.

**Rescue DAG Generated When There Are Parse Errors**

Starting in HTCondor version 7.5.5, passing the **-DumpRescue** option
to either *condor_dagman* or *condor_submit_dag* causes
*condor_dagman* to output a Rescue DAG file, even if the parsing of a
DAG input file fails. In this parse failure case, *condor_dagman*
produces a specially named Rescue DAG containing whatever it had
successfully parsed up until the point of the parse error. This Rescue
DAG may be useful in debugging parse errors in complex DAGs, especially
ones using splices. This incomplete Rescue DAG is not meant to be used
when resubmitting a failed DAG. Note that this incomplete Rescue DAG
generated by the **-DumpRescue** option is a full DAG input file, as
produced by versions of HTCondor prior to HTCondor version 7.7.2. It is
not a partial Rescue DAG file, regardless of the value of the
configuration variable ``DAGMAN_WRITE_PARTIAL_RESCUE``
:index:`DAGMAN_WRITE_PARTIAL_RESCUE`.

To avoid confusion between this incomplete Rescue DAG generated in the
case of a parse failure and a usable Rescue DAG, a different name is
given to the incomplete Rescue DAG. The name appends the string
``.parse_failed`` to the original DAG input file name. Therefore, if the
submission of a DAG with

.. code-block:: console

    $ condor_submit_dag  my.dag

has a parse failure, the resulting incomplete Rescue DAG will be named
``my.dag.parse_failed``.

To further prevent one of these incomplete Rescue DAG files from being
used, a line within the file contains the single command *REJECT*. This
causes *condor_dagman* to reject the DAG, if used as a DAG input file.
This is done because the incomplete Rescue DAG may be a syntactically
correct DAG input file. It will be incomplete relative to the original
DAG, such that if the incomplete Rescue DAG could be run, it could
erroneously be perceived as having successfully executed the desired
workflow, when, in fact, it did not.

DAG Recovery
------------

:index:`DAG recovery<single: DAG recovery; DAGMan>`
:index:`difference between Rescue DAG and DAG recovery<single: difference between Rescue DAG and DAG recovery; DAGMan>`

DAG recovery restores the state of a DAG upon resubmission. Recovery is
accomplished by reading the ``.nodes.log`` file that is used to enforce
the dependencies of the DAG. The DAG can then continue towards
completion.

Recovery is different than a Rescue DAG. Recovery is appropriate when no
Rescue DAG has been created. There will be no Rescue DAG if the machine
running the *condor_dagman* job crashes, or if the *condor_schedd*
daemon crashes, or if the *condor_dagman* job crashes, or if the
*condor_dagman* job is placed on hold.

Much of the time, when a not-completed DAG is re-submitted, it will
automatically be placed into recovery mode due to the existence and
contents of a lock file created as the DAG is first run. In recovery
mode, the ``.nodes.log`` is used to identify nodes that have completed
and should not be re-submitted.

DAGMan can be told to work in recovery mode by including the
**-DoRecovery** option on the command line, as in the example

.. code-block:: console

    $ condor_submit_dag diamond.dag -DoRecovery

where ``diamond.dag`` is the name of the DAG input file.

When debugging a DAG in which something has gone wrong, a first
determination is whether a resubmission will use a Rescue DAG or benefit
from recovery. The existence of a Rescue DAG means that recovery would
be inappropriate. A Rescue DAG is has a file name ending in
``.rescue<XXX>``, where ``<XXX>`` is replaced by a 3-digit number.

Determine if a DAG ever completed (independent of whether it was
successful or not) by looking at the last lines of the ``.dagman.out``
file. If there is a line similar to

.. code-block:: text

    (condor_DAGMAN) pid 445 EXITING WITH STATUS 0

then the DAG completed. This line explains that the *condor_dagman* job
finished normally. If there is no line similar to this at the end of the
``.dagman.out`` file, and output from *condor_q* shows that the
*condor_dagman* job for the DAG being debugged is not in the queue,
then recovery is indicated.

.. _visualizing-dags-with-dot:

Visualizing DAGs with *dot*
---------------------------

:index:`DOT command<single: DOT command; DAG input file>`
:index:`visualizing DAGs<single: visualizing DAGs; DAGMan>`

It can be helpful to see a picture of a DAG. DAGMan can assist you in
visualizing a DAG by creating the input files used by the AT&T Research
Labs *graphviz* package. *dot* is a program within this package,
available from `http://www.graphviz.org/ <http://www.graphviz.org/>`_,
and it is used to draw pictures of DAGs.

DAGMan produces one or more dot files as the result of an extra line in
a DAG input file. The line appears as

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    DOT dag.dot

This creates a file called ``dag.dot``. which contains a specification
of the DAG before any jobs within the DAG are submitted to HTCondor. The
``dag.dot`` file is used to create a visualization of the DAG by using
this file as input to *dot*. This example creates a Postscript file,
with a visualization of the DAG:

.. code-block:: console

    $ dot -Tps dag.dot -o dag.ps

Within the DAG input file, the DOT command can take several optional
parameters:

-  **UPDATE** This will update the dot file every time a significant
   update happens.
-  **DONT-UPDATE** Creates a single dot file, when the DAGMan begins
   executing. This is the default if the parameter **UPDATE** is not
   used.
-  **OVERWRITE** Overwrites the dot file each time it is created. This
   is the default, unless **DONT-OVERWRITE** is specified.
-  **DONT-OVERWRITE** Used to create multiple dot files, instead of
   overwriting the single one specified. To create file names, DAGMan
   uses the name of the file concatenated with a period and an integer.
   For example, the DAG input file line

   .. code-block:: condor-dagman

        DOT dag.dot DONT-OVERWRITE

   causes files ``dag.dot.0``, ``dag.dot.1``, ``dag.dot.2``, etc. to be
   created. This option is most useful when combined with the **UPDATE**
   option to visualize the history of the DAG after it has finished
   executing.

-  **INCLUDE** *path-to-filename* Includes the contents of a file
   given by ``path-to-filename`` in the file produced by the **DOT**
   command. The include file contents are always placed after the line
   of the form label=. This may be useful if further editing of the
   created files would be necessary, perhaps because you are
   automatically visualizing the DAG as it progresses.

If conflicting parameters are used in a DOT command, the last one listed
is used.

.. _node-status-file:

Capturing the Status of Nodes in a File
---------------------------------------

:index:`NODE_STATUS_FILE command<single: NODE_STATUS_FILE command; DAG input file>`
:index:`node status file<single: node status file; DAGMan>`
:index:`of DAG nodes<single: of DAG nodes; status>`

DAGMan can capture the status of the overall DAG and all DAG nodes in a
node status file, such that the user or a script can monitor this
status. This file is periodically rewritten while the DAG runs. To
enable this feature, the DAG input file must contain a line with the
*NODE_STATUS_FILE* command.

The syntax for a *NODE_STATUS_FILE* command is

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    NODE_STATUS_FILE statusFileName [minimumUpdateTime] [ALWAYS-UPDATE]

The status file is written on the machine on which the DAG is submitted;
its location is given by *statusFileName*, and it may be a full path and
file name.

The optional *minimumUpdateTime* specifies the minimum number of seconds
that must elapse between updates to the node status file. This setting
exists to avoid having DAGMan spend too much time writing the node
status file for very large DAGs. If no value is specified, this value
defaults to 60 seconds (as of version 8.5.8; previously, it defaulted to
0). The node status file can be updated at most once per
``DAGMAN_USER_LOG_SCAN_INTERVAL``
:index:`DAGMAN_USER_LOG_SCAN_INTERVAL`, as defined in
ref:`admin-manual/configuration-macros:configuration file entries for dagman`,
no matter how small the *minimumUpdateTime* value. Also, the node status
file will be updated when the DAG finishes, whether successfully or not,
even if *minimumUpdateTime* seconds have not elapsed since the last
update.

Normally, the node status file is only updated if the status of some
nodes has changed since the last time the file was written. However, the
optional *ALWAYS-UPDATE* keyword specifies that the node status file
should be updated every time the minimum update time (and
``DAGMAN_USER_LOG_SCAN_INTERVAL``
:index:`DAGMAN_USER_LOG_SCAN_INTERVAL`), has passed, even if no
nodes have changed status since the last time the file was updated. (The
file will change slightly, because timestamps will be updated.) For
performance reasons, large DAGs with approximately 10,000 or more nodes
are poor candidates for using the *ALWAYS-UPDATE* option.

As an example, if the DAG input file contains the line

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    NODE_STATUS_FILE my.dag.status 30

the file ``my.dag.status`` will be rewritten at intervals of 30 seconds
or more.

This node status file is overwritten each time it is updated. Therefore,
it only holds information about the current status of each node; it does
not provide a history of the node status.


.. versionchanged:: 8.1.6

    HTCondor version 8.1.6 changes the format of the node status file.

The node status file is a collection of ClassAds in New ClassAd format.
There is one ClassAd for the overall status of the DAG, one ClassAd for
the status of each node, and one ClassAd with the time at which the node
status file was completed as well as the time of the next update.

Here is an example portion of a node status file:

.. code-block:: condor-classad

    [
      Type = "DagStatus";
      DagFiles = {
        "job_dagman_node_status.dag"
      };
      Timestamp = 1399674138;
      DagStatus = 3;
      NodesTotal = 12;
      NodesDone = 11;
      NodesPre = 0;
      NodesQueued = 1;
      NodesPost = 0;
      NodesReady = 0;
      NodesUnready = 0;
      NodesFailed = 0;
      JobProcsHeld = 0;
      JobProcsIdle = 1;
    ]
    [
      Type = "NodeStatus";
      Node = "A";
      NodeStatus = 5;
      StatusDetails = "";
      RetryCount = 0;
      JobProcsQueued = 0;
      JobProcsHeld = 0;
    ]
    ...
    [
      Type = "NodeStatus";
      Node = "C";
      NodeStatus = 3;
      StatusDetails = "idle";
      RetryCount = 0;
      JobProcsQueued = 1;
      JobProcsHeld = 0;
    ]
    [
      Type = "StatusEnd";
      EndTime = 1399674138;
      NextUpdate = 1399674141;
    ]

Possible ``DagStatus`` and ``NodeStatus`` attribute values are:

-  0 (STATUS_NOT_READY): At least one parent has not yet finished or
   the node is a FINAL node.
-  1 (STATUS_READY): All parents have finished, but the node is not yet
   running.
-  2 (STATUS_PRERUN): The node's PRE script is running.
-  3 (STATUS_SUBMITTED): The node's HTCondor job(s) are in the queue.
-  4 (STATUS_POSTRUN): The node's POST script is running.
-  5 (STATUS_DONE): The node has completed successfully.
-  6 (STATUS_ERROR): The node has failed.

A *NODE_STATUS_FILE* command inside any splice is ignored. If multiple
DAG files are specified on the *condor_submit_dag* command line, and
more than one specifies a node status file, the first specification
takes precedence.

A Machine-Readable Event History, the jobstate.log File
-------------------------------------------------------

:index:`JOBSTATE_LOG command<single: JOBSTATE_LOG command; DAG input file>`
:index:`jobstate.log file<single: jobstate.log file; DAGMan>`
:index:`machine-readable event history<single: machine-readable event history; DAGMan>`

DAGMan can produce a machine-readable history of events. The
``jobstate.log`` file is designed for use by the Pegasus Workflow
Management System, which operates as a layer on top of DAGMan. Pegasus
uses the ``jobstate.log`` file to monitor the state of a workflow. The
``jobstate.log`` file can used by any automated tool for the monitoring
of workflows.

DAGMan produces this file when the command *JOBSTATE_LOG* is in the DAG
input file. The syntax for *JOBSTATE_LOG* is

**JOBSTATE_LOG** *JobstateLogFileName*

No more than one ``jobstate.log`` file can be created by a single
instance of *condor_dagman*. If more than one ``jobstate.log`` file is
specified, the first file name specified will take effect, and a warning
will be printed in the ``dagman.out`` file when subsequent
*JOBSTATE_LOG* specifications are parsed. Multiple specifications may
exist in the same DAG file, within splices, or within multiple,
independent DAGs run with a single *condor_dagman* instance.

The ``jobstate.log`` file can be considered a filtered version of the
``dagman.out`` file, in a machine-readable format. It contains the
actual node job events that from *condor_dagman*, plus some additional
meta-events.

The ``jobstate.log`` file is different from the node status file, in
that the ``jobstate.log`` file is appended to, rather than being
overwritten as the DAG runs. Therefore, it contains a history of the
DAG, rather than a snapshot of the current state of the DAG.

There are 5 line types in the ``jobstate.log`` file. Each line begins
with a Unix timestamp in the form of seconds since the Epoch. Fields
within each line are separated by a single space character.

*   **DAGMan start**: This line identifies the *condor_dagman* job. 
    The formatting of the line is

    .. code-block:: text

        timestamp INTERNAL \*** DAGMAN_STARTED dagmanCondorID \***

    The *dagmanCondorID* field is the *condor_dagman* job's
    ``ClusterId`` attribute, a period, and the ``ProcId`` attribute.

*   **DAGMan exit**: This line identifies the completion of the *condor_dagman*
    job. The formatting of the line is

    .. code-block:: text

        timestamp INTERNAL \*** DAGMAN_FINISHED exitCode \***

    The *exitCode* field is value the *condor_dagman* job returns upon
    exit.

*   **Recovery started**:  If the *condor_dagman* job goes into recovery mode,
    this meta-event is printed. During recovery mode, events will only be 
    printed in the file if they were not already printed before recovery mode
    started. The formatting of the line is

    .. code-block:: text

        timestamp INTERNAL \*** RECOVERY_STARTED \***

*   **Recovery finished or Recovery failure**: At the end of recovery mode, 
    either a RECOVERY_FINISHED or RECOVERY_FAILURE meta-event will be printed,
    as appropriate. The formatting of the line is

    .. code-block:: text

        timestamp INTERNAL \*** RECOVERY_FINISHED \***

    or

    .. code-block:: text

        timestamp INTERNAL \*** RECOVERY_FAILURE \***

*   **Normal**:  This line is used for all other event and meta-event types.
    The formatting of the line is

    .. code-block:: text

        timestamp JobName eventName condorID jobTag - sequenceNumber

    The *JobName* is the name given to the node job as defined in the
    DAG input file with the command *JOB*. It identifies the node within
    the DAG.

    The *eventName* is one of the many defined event or meta-events
    given in the lists below.

    The *condorID* field is the job's ``ClusterId`` attribute, a period,
    and the ``ProcId`` attribute. There is no *condorID* assigned yet
    for some meta-events, such as PRE_SCRIPT_STARTED. For these, the
    dash character ('-') is printed.

    The *jobTag* field is defined for the Pegasus workflow manager. Its
    usage is generalized to be useful to other workflow managers.
    Pegasus-managed jobs add a line of the following form to their
    HTCondor submit description file:

    .. code-block:: condor-submit

        +pegasus_site = "local"

    This defines the string ``local`` as the *jobTag* field.

    Generalized usage adds a set of 2 commands to the HTCondor submit
    description file to define a string as the *jobTag* field:

    .. code-block:: condor-submit

        +job_tag_name = "+job_tag_value"
        +job_tag_value = "viz"

    This defines the string ``viz`` as the *jobTag* field. Without any
    of these added lines within the HTCondor submit description file,
    the dash character ('-') is printed for the *jobTag* field.

    The *sequenceNumber* is a monotonically-increasing number that
    starts at one. It is associated with each attempt at running a node.
    If a node is retried, it gets a new sequence number; a submit
    failure does not result in a new sequence number. When a Rescue DAG
    is run, the sequence numbers pick up from where they left off within
    the previous attempt at running the DAG. Note that this only applies
    if the Rescue DAG is run automatically or with the *-dorescuefrom*
    command-line option.

Here is an example of a very simple Pegasus ``jobstate.log`` file,
assuming the example *jobTag* field of ``local``:

.. code-block:: text

    1292620511 INTERNAL *** DAGMAN_STARTED 4972.0 ***
    1292620523 NodeA PRE_SCRIPT_STARTED - local - 1
    1292620523 NodeA PRE_SCRIPT_SUCCESS - local - 1
    1292620525 NodeA SUBMIT 4973.0 local - 1
    1292620525 NodeA EXECUTE 4973.0 local - 1
    1292620526 NodeA JOB_TERMINATED 4973.0 local - 1
    1292620526 NodeA JOB_SUCCESS 0 local - 1

    1292620531 NodeA POST_SCRIPT_SUCCESS 4973.0 local - 1
    1292620535 INTERNAL *** DAGMAN_FINISHED 0 ***


Status Information for the DAG in a ClassAd
-------------------------------------------

:index:`DAG status in a job ClassAd<single: DAG status in a job ClassAd; DAGMan>`

The *condor_dagman* job places information about the status of the DAG
into its own job ClassAd. The attributes are fully described in
:doc:`/classad-attributes/job-classad-attributes`. The attributes are

-  ``DAG_NodesTotal``
-  ``DAG_NodesDone``
-  ``DAG_NodesPrerun``
-  ``DAG_NodesQueued``
-  ``DAG_NodesPostrun``
-  ``DAG_NodesReady``
-  ``DAG_NodesFailed``
-  ``DAG_NodesUnready``
-  ``DAG_Status``
-  ``DAG_InRecovery``

Note that most of this information is also available in the
``dagman.out`` file as described in
:ref:`users-manual/dagman-workflows:dag monitoring`.

Managing Large Numbers of Jobs with DAGMan
------------------------------------------

:index:`large numbers of jobs<single: large numbers of jobs; DAGMan>`

Using DAGMan is recommended when submitting large numbers of jobs. The
recommendation holds whether the jobs are represented by a DAG due to
dependencies, or all the jobs are independent of each other, such as
they might be in a parameter sweep. DAGMan offers:

* Throttling
    Throttling limits the number of submitted jobs at any point in time.

* Retry of jobs that fail
    This is a useful tool when an intermittent error may cause a job to
    fail or may cause a job to fail to run to completion when attempted
    at one point in time, but not at another point in time. The
    conditions under which retry occurs are user-defined. In addition,
    the administrative support that facilitates the rerunning of only
    those jobs that fail is automatically generated.

* Scripts associated with node jobs
    PRE and POST scripts run on the submit host before and/or after the
    execution of specified node jobs.

Each of these capabilities is described in detail within this manual
section about DAGMan. To make effective use of DAGMan, there is no way
around reading the appropriate subsections.

To run DAGMan with large numbers of independent jobs, there are
generally two ways of organizing and specifying the files that control
the jobs. Both ways presume that programs or scripts will generate
needed files, because the file contents are either large and repetitive,
or because there are a large number of similar files to be generated
representing the large numbers of jobs. The two file types needed are
the DAG input file and the submit description file(s) for the HTCondor
jobs represented. Each of the two ways is presented separately:

A unique submit description file for each of the many jobs.
A single DAG input file lists each of the jobs and specifies a
distinct submit description file for each job. The DAG input file is
simple to generate, as it chooses an identifier for each job and
names the submit description file. For example, the simplest DAG
input file for a set of 1000 independent jobs, as might be part of a
parameter sweep, appears as

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # file sweep.dag
    JOB job0 job0.submit
    JOB job1 job1.submit
    JOB job2 job2.submit
    ...
    JOB job999 job999.submit

There are 1000 submit description files, with a unique one for each
of the job<N> jobs. Assuming that all files associated with this set
of jobs are in the same directory, and that files continue the same
naming and numbering scheme, the submit description file for
``job6.submit`` might appear as

.. code-block:: condor-submit

    # file job6.submit
    universe = vanilla
    executable = /path/to/executable
    log = job6.log
    input = job6.in
    output = job6.out
    arguments = "-file job6.out"
    queue

Submission of the entire set of jobs uses the command line:

.. code-block:: console

    $ condor_submit_dag sweep.dag

A benefit to having unique submit description files for each of the
jobs is that they are available if one of the jobs needs to be
submitted individually. A drawback to having unique submit
description files for each of the jobs is that there are lots of
submit description files.

Single submit description file.
A single HTCondor submit description file might be used for all the
many jobs of the parameter sweep. To distinguish the jobs and their
associated distinct input and output files, the DAG input file
assigns a unique identifier with the *VARS* command.

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # file sweep.dag
    JOB job0 common.submit
    VARS job0 runnumber="0"
    JOB job1 common.submit
    VARS job1 runnumber="1"
    JOB job2 common.submit
    VARS job2 runnumber="2"
    ...
    JOB job999 common.submit
    VARS job999 runnumber="999"

The single submit description file for all these jobs utilizes the
``runnumber`` variable value in its identification of the job's
files. This submit description file might appear as

.. code-block:: condor-submit

    # file common.submit
    universe = vanilla
    executable = /path/to/executable
    log = wholeDAG.log
    input = job$(runnumber).in
    output = job$(runnumber).out
    arguments = "-$(runnumber)"
    queue

The job with ``runnumber="8"`` expects to find its input file
``job8.in`` in the single, common directory, and it sends its output
to ``job8.out``. The single log for all job events of the entire DAG
is ``wholeDAG.log``. Using one file for the entire DAG meets the
limitation that no macro substitution may be specified for the job
log file, and it is likely more efficient as well. This node's
executable is invoked with

.. code-block:: text

    /path/to/executable -8

These examples work well with respect to file naming and file location
when there are less than several thousand jobs submitted as part of a
DAG. The large numbers of files per directory becomes an issue when
there are greater than several thousand jobs submitted as part of a DAG.
In this case, consider a more hierarchical structure for the files
instead of a single directory. Introduce a separate directory for each
run. For example, if there were 10,000 jobs, there would be 10,000
directories, one for each of these jobs. The directories are presumed to
be generated and populated by programs or scripts that, like the
previous examples, utilize a run number. Each of these directories named
utilizing the run number will be used for the input, output, and log
files for one of the many jobs.

As an example, for this set of 10,000 jobs and directories, assume that
there is a run number of 600. The directory will be named ``dir600``,
and it will hold the 3 files called ``in``, ``out``, and ``log``,
representing the input, output, and HTCondor job log files associated
with run number 600.

The DAG input file sets a variable representing the run number, as in
the previous example:

.. code-block:: condor-dagman

    # file biggersweep.dag
    JOB job0 bigger.submit
    VARS job0 runnumber="0"
    JOB job1 bigger.submit
    VARS job1 runnumber="1"
    JOB job2 bigger.submit
    VARS job2 runnumber="2"
    .
    .
    .
    JOB job9999 bigger.submit
    VARS job9999 runnumber="9999"

A single HTCondor submit description file may be written. It resides in
the same directory as the DAG input file.

.. code-block:: condor-submit

    # file bigger.submit
    universe = vanilla
    executable = /path/to/executable
    log = log
    input = in
    output = out
    arguments = "-$(runnumber)"
    initialdir = dir$(runnumber)
    queue

One item to care about with this set up is the underlying file system
for the pool. The transfer of files (or not) when using
**initialdir** :index:`initialdir<single: initialdir; submit commands>` differs
based upon the job
**universe** :index:`universe<single: universe; submit commands>` and whether or
not there is a shared file system. See the :doc:`/man-pages/condor_submit` 
manual page for the details on the submit command.

Submission of this set of jobs is no different than the previous
examples. With the current working directory the same as the one
containing the submit description file, the DAG input file, and the
subdirectories:

.. code-block:: console

    $ condor_submit_dag biggersweep.dag

Workflow Metrics
----------------

:index:`workflow metrics<single: workflow metrics; DAGMan>`

For every DAG, a metrics file is created.
This metrics file is named ``<dag_file_name>.metrics``,
where ``<dag_file_name>`` is the name of the DAG input file. In a
workflow with nested DAGs, each nested DAG will create its own metrics
file.

Here is an example metrics output file:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "client":"condor_dagman",
        "version":"8.1.0",
        "planner":"/lfs1/devel/Pegasus/pegasus/bin/pegasus-plan",
        "planner_version":"4.3.0cvs",
        "type":"metrics",
        "wf_uuid":"htcondor-test-job_dagman_metrics-A-subdag",
        "root_wf_uuid":"htcondor-test-job_dagman_metrics-A",
        "start_time":1375313459.603,
        "end_time":1375313491.498,
        "duration":31.895,
        "exitcode":1,
        "dagman_id":"26",
        "parent_dagman_id":"11",
        "rescue_dag_number":0,
        "jobs":4,
        "jobs_failed":1,
        "jobs_succeeded":3,
        "dag_jobs":0,
        "dag_jobs_failed":0,
        "dag_jobs_succeeded":0,
        "total_jobs":4,
        "total_jobs_run":4,
        "total_job_time":0.000,
        "dag_status":2
    }

Here is an explanation of each of the items in the file:

-  ``client``: the name of the client workflow software; in the example,
   it is ``"condor_dagman"``
-  ``version``: the version of the client workflow software
-  ``planner``: the workflow planner, as read from the ``braindump.txt``
   file
-  ``planner_version``: the planner software version, as read from the
   ``braindump.txt`` file
-  ``type``: the type of data, ``"metrics"``
-  ``wf_uuid``: the workflow ID, generated by *pegasus-plan*, as read
   from the ``braindump.txt`` file
-  ``root_wf_uuid``: the root workflow ID, which is relevant for nested
   workflows. It is generated by *pegasus-plan*, as read from the
   ``braindump.txt`` file.
-  ``start_time``: the start time of the client, in epoch seconds, with
   millisecond precision
-  ``end_time``: the end time of the client, in epoch seconds, with
   millisecond precision
-  ``duration``: the duration of the client, in seconds, with
   millisecond precision
-  ``exitcode``: the *condor_dagman* exit code
-  ``dagman_id``: the value of the ``ClusterId`` attribute of the
   *condor_dagman* instance
-  ``parent_dagman_id``: the value of the ``ClusterId`` attribute of the
   parent *condor_dagman* instance of this DAG; empty if this DAG is
   not a SUBDAG
-  ``rescue_dag_number``: the number of the Rescue DAG being run, or 0
   if not running a Rescue DAG
-  ``jobs``: the number of nodes in the DAG input file, not including
   SUBDAG nodes
-  ``jobs_failed``: the number of failed nodes in the workflow, not
   including SUBDAG nodes
-  ``jobs_succeeded``: the number of successful nodes in the workflow,
   not including SUBDAG nodes; this includes jobs that succeeded after
   retries
-  ``dag_jobs``: the number of SUBDAG nodes in the DAG input file
-  ``dag_jobs_failed``: the number of SUBDAG nodes that failed
-  ``dag_jobs_succeeded``: the number of SUBDAG nodes that succeeded
-  ``total_jobs``: the total number of jobs in the DAG input file
-  ``total_jobs_run``: the total number of nodes executed in a DAG. It
   should be equal to
   ``jobs_succeeded + jobs_failed + dag_jobs_succeeded + dag_jobs_failed``
-  ``total_job_time``: the sum of the time between the first execute
   event and the terminated event for all jobs that are not SUBDAGs
-  ``dag_status``: the final status of the DAG, with values

   -  ``0``: OK
   -  ``1``: error; an error condition different than those listed here
   -  ``2``: one or more nodes in the DAG have failed
   -  ``3``: the DAG has been aborted by an ABORT-DAG-ON specification
   -  ``4``: removed; the DAG has been removed by *condor_rm*
   -  ``5``: a cycle was found in the DAG
   -  ``6``: the DAG has been halted; see the
      :ref:`users-manual/dagman-workflows:suspending a running dag` section
      for an explanation of halting a DAG

   Note that any ``dag_status`` other than 0 corresponds to a non-zero
   exit code.

The ``braindump.txt`` file is generated by *pegasus-plan*; the name of
the ``braindump.txt`` file is specified with the
``PEGASUS_BRAINDUMP_FILE`` environment variable. If not specified, the
file name defaults to ``braindump.txt``, and it is placed in the current
directory.

Note that the ``total_job_time`` value is always zero, because the
calculation of that value has not yet been implemented.

DAGMan and Accounting Groups
----------------------------

:index:`accounting groups<single: accounting groups; DAGMan>`

As of version 8.5.6, *condor_dagman* propagates
**accounting_group** :index:`accounting_group<single: accounting_group; submit commands>`
and
**accounting_group_user** :index:`accounting_group_user<single: accounting_group_user; submit commands>`
values specified for *condor_dagman* itself to all jobs within the DAG
(including sub-DAGs).

The
**accounting_group** :index:`accounting_group<single: accounting_group; submit commands>`
and
**accounting_group_user** :index:`accounting_group_user<single: accounting_group_user; submit commands>`
values can be specified using the **-append** flag to
*condor_submit_dag*, for example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ condor_submit_dag -append accounting_group=group_physics -append \
      accounting_group_user=albert relativity.dag

See :ref:`admin-manual/user-priorities-negotiation:group accounting`
for a discussion of group accounting and
:ref:`admin-manual/user-priorities-negotiation:accounting groups with
hierarchical group quotas` for a discussion of accounting groups with
hierarchical group quotas.
