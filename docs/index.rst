HTCondor Version |release| Manual
=================================

The HTCondor Software Suite (HTCSS) is a software system that creates a High-Throughput Computing (HTC) environment.  
This environment might be a single cluster, a set of related clusters on a campus, cloud resources, or
national or international federations of computers.

If you are a user of HTCondor, and have been given a login or credentials to use a batch scheduler on an
Access Point (sometimes called a scheduler or login node), you may want to read our Quick Start guide
here: :ref:`users-manual/quick-start-guide:Users' Quick Start Guide`

If you are a beginning administrator of HTCondor, or want to install it for the first time, please
look at our installation guide here: :ref:`getting-htcondor/index:Downloading and Installing`

Otherwise, for users of HTCondor who want more information, a complete user's reference manual
is here: :ref:`users-manual/index:Users' Manual`, and a similar complete reference for 
administrators of HTCondor can be found here: :ref:`admin-manual/index:Administrators' Manual`

HTCondor contains many command line tools, each with a traditional Unix "man-page". These
may be found here: :ref:`man-pages/index:Commands Reference (man pages)`

Finally, for users writing Python interfaces to HTCondor, our Python API documentation
is here: :ref:`apis/python-bindings/index:Python Bindings`

A complete table of contents follows.
