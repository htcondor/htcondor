.. _admin_install_windows:

Windows (as Administrator)
==========================

Installation of HTCondor must be done by a user with administrator
privileges.  We have provided quickstart instructions below to walk
you through a single-node HTCondor installation using the HTCondor
Windows installer GUI.

For more information about the installation options, or how to use
the installer in unattended batch mode, see the complete
:doc:`../platform-specific/windows-installer` guide.

It is possible to manually install HTCondor on Windows, without the
provided MSI program, but we strongly discourage this unless you have
a specific need for this approach and have extensive HTCondor experience.

Quickstart Installation Instructions
------------------------------------

To download the latest HTCondor Windows Installer:

#.  Go to the
    `current channel <https://htcss-downloads.chtc.wisc.edu/tarball/current/>`_
    download site.
#.  Click on the second-latest version.  (The latest version should always be
    the under-development version and will only have ``daily`` builds.)
#.  Click on the ``release`` folder.
#.  Click on the file ending in ``.msi`` (usually the first one).

Start the installer by double clicking on the MSI file once it's downloaded.
Then follow the directions below for each option.

If HTCondor is already installed.
    If HTCondor has been previously installed, a dialog box will appear
    before the installation of HTCondor proceeds. The question asks if
    you wish to preserve your current HTCondor configuration files.
    Answer yes or no, as appropriate.

    If you answer yes, your configuration files will not be changed, and
    you will proceed to the point where the new binaries will be
    installed.

    If you answer no, then there will be a second question that asks if
    you want to use answers given during the previous installation as
    default answers.

STEP 1: License Agreement.
    Agree to the HTCondor license agreement.

STEP 2: HTCondor Pool Configuration.
    Choose the option to create a new pool and enter a name.

STEP 3: This Machine's Roles.
    Check the "submit jobs" box.  From the list of execution options,
    choose "always run jobs".

STEP 4: The Account Domain.
    Skip this entry.

STEP 5: E-mail Settings.
    Specify the desired email address(es), if any.

STEP 6: Java Settings.
    If this entry is already set, accept it.  Otherwise, skip it.

STEP 7: Access Permission Settings.
    Accept the default values.  You can change these later by modifying the configuration files.

STEP 8: VM Universe Setting.
    Disable the **vm** universe.

STEP 9: Choose Destination Folder
    :index:`location of files<single: location of files; installation>`

    Accept the default settings.

This should complete the installation process. The installer will have
automatically started HTCondor in the background and you do **not** need to
restart Windows for HTCondor to work.

Open a command prompt to follow the next set of instructions.

.. _admin_install_windows_pool:

Setting Up a Whole Pool with Windows
------------------------------------

Follow the instructions above through Step 1. Then, customize the
installation as follows:

STEP 2: HTCondor Pool Configuration.
    Create a new pool
    only on the machine you've chosen as their central manager.  See
    the :doc:`admin-quick-start`.  Otherwise, choose the option to
    join an existing pool and enter the name or IP address of the
    central manager.

STEP 3: This Machine's Roles.
    Check the "submit jobs"
    box to select the submit role, or choose "always run jobs" to select
    the execute role.

STEP 4: The Account Domain.
    Enter the
    same name on all submit-role machines.  This helps ensure that a
    user can't get more resources by logging in to more than one machine.

STEP 5: E-mail Settings.
    Specify the desired email address(es), if any.

STEP 6: Java Settings.
    If this entry is already set, accept it.  Otherwise, skip it.

    Experienced users who know they want to use the **java** universe
    should instead enter the path to the Java executable on the machine,
    if it isn't already set, or they want to use a different one.

    To disable use of the **java** universe, leave the field blank.

STEP 7: Access Permission Settings.
    Machines within the HTCondor pool will need various types of access
    permission. The three categories of permission that can be set here 
    are read, write, and administrator.  The values can be usernames, hostnames
    or IP address ranges, Wild cards and macros are permitted.
    It is recommended that you accept the defaults here and change the
    values later as needed by modifying the HTCondor configuration files.

     Read
        Read access allows a machine to obtain information about
        HTCondor such as the status of machines in the pool and the job
        queues.  If all of your HTCondor machines and users are in
        a single DNS domain or IP Address range, setting this to \*.domain
        an IP address range with wildcards is a good choice.
        See ``ALLOW_READ`` :index:`ALLOW_READ`
     Write
        Write access is for submitting jobs to the Schedd.   Setting this
        to ``*`` will allow any user that can login to the machine submit jobs.
        See ``ALLOW_WRITE`` :index:`ALLOW_WRITE`
     Administrator
        Administrator access is for starting and stopping the daemons
        and sending administrative commands such as reconfig and drain.
        By default the installer will give this permission to the Windows
        user that runs the installer and to the Windows ``Adminstrator`` account.
        See ``ALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR`` :index:`ALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR`

    For more details on these access permissions, and others that can be
    manually changed in your configuration file, please see the section
    titled Setting Up Security in HTCondor in the
    :ref:`admin-manual/security:authorization` section.

STEP 8: VM Universe Setting.
    Disable the **vm** universe.

    Experienced users with VMWare and Perl already installed may enable
    the **vm** universe.

STEP 9: Choose Destination Folder
    :index:`location of files<single: location of files; installation>`

    Experienced users may change the default installation path
    (``c:\Condor``), but we don't recommend doing so.  Certain jobs may
    not run if the installation path has a space in it.
